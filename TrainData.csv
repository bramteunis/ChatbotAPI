This is abundantly on top of the hardship experienced and is repeated for me. Cooper requesting a hardship letter already issued in the complaint process Read below of death by COVID ... tenant sick    after dad died. Then on top of that Mr. Cooper causing more hardship with this situation. 


This letter is regarding Mr Cooper mortgage company 's behavior and actions over the phone over the last   years out of Texas        Texas  and wherever their call centers are located that we do not know of. 


When we call we talked to  different people over a period of   months or longer and we never are given the same information. We call in to make a monthly payment and it is a hassle. We talked to a phone tree for  minutes and finally get to speak to a representative to make the payment it always takes too long and the representative is unfriendly to help us process the payment. When calling in or receiving letters we were never given accurate balances per month and we were charged finance charges and late fees and other fees for miscommunication between Mr Cooper and us which never should have taken place because it should be easy to make a payment per month and given a balance. This was held back purposely by the way you train your call centers to charge these fees. This paragraph is about  and   before moving to senior housing living dealing with Mr Cooper from    and how up to this date it has wrecked credit scores for  and  . 


This paragraph is about tenants trying to make payments who are the son of  &   and the  who is       of   whom is  of    . During  and     , who is   of   who is the   of  and   and are the   of     for     of the   at     The situation in all parties trying to make payments and giving permission to make payments we're trying to make payments every month calling in and they were hassled and given permission to make the payments by a letter of declaration that was also a hassle. When   and   tried to call in to make payments the same problem with  minutes of a phone tree to get to a representative and the representative was not helpful to take the payment and whenever the confusion of making these payments there were late fees that were unknown.. there were extra charges unknown added to the loan without communication by Mr Cooper to give a proper balance per month.  a  r died in  of covid and we were offered by Mr Cooper covid relief filling out forms every 3 months. We know that Mr Cooper accepted government money of the covid relief program to disperse. We were given empty promises that this covid relief would either replace the payments or do a forbearance to hold off on monthly payments. Then in  of  and       and   tenant of    had   and the forms were still being filled out every   months. Then in    tenant of    had   again in  and  of  and these forms were still being filled out by  and  . This exasperating process was supposed to at least get forbearance or at the very best pay the payments but then Mr Cooper came back and said none of this worked none of this was going to hold off the payments and we were surprised with {$18000.00} of catching up with the loan and before that in between of filling out the paperwork we were told that we had to make payments and we kept filling out the paperwork in hopes to just start fresh with the {$700.00} per month payment but they before that said oh it's {$3000.00} or {$4000.00} to catch up on. Payment per month. So we kept filling out the paperwork and hopes that this covid relief would take place or forbearance could start us fresh at  $ per month agreement and it never did. 


Now Mr Cooper has done a foreclosure for // and we are going to do whatever we can to do an injunction to stop foreclosure and by law of Missouri do a loan modification and have an agency  and HUD and   help us speak with Mr Cooper. There will be no more phone calls because Mr Cooper can not be trusted over the phone. All communication and information will all be in writing for now on and Mr Cooper must respond by law and by law of Missouri in a loan modification. Missouri law states that no foreclosure can take place in a loan modification. We need the agency of  and HUD and the     to intervene with this process because Mr Cooper can not be trusted over the phone as we've tried this for years. I,  , am living at     so loan modification by    must be accomplished with Mr. Cooper allowing loan modification by   . 


And if necessary after we figure all this out with loan modification and stopping foreclosure and trying to get out from under Mr Cooper and   using his finances to buy the loan out we want to look into suing Mr Cooper for all the harassment, all the lies, all the problems over the phone that have happened for years and they have these recordings but most likely they will loose these recordings that are in their system of all these phone calls. 

Never should it end up this way especially after Mr Cooper received COVID relief from us government..

Next, I want to thank you for your thoroughness and excellent communication skills by keeping me informed throughout this process.

-After reading, I called   inform him that I am a 100 %  Veteran and that I am not to pay the {$5400.00} Funding Fee that is included in the Loan Estimate. He stated that this was only an Estimate and my acknowledgement is only for receiving it. ( He also informed me that my nterest Rate was locked in for 60 days at 2.875 % ) -I asked him about how to submit my Award Letters and he stated, "" There will be a time to do that later. '' // : -I received an email asking me to take a  minute survey, but there was no option to respond to the survey. 
-Received Outstanding Items email from   well as a call indicating he was having issues getting my credit reports.

He later emailed me at  to indicate, ""  is not reporting. '' I contacted all  Credit Bureaus again and it was confirmed AGAIN that all  Bureaus were still unfrozen through //.

If my experience from the inception of becoming a NFCU member will continue in this dubious manner, I am considering cancelling my membership! 

I HIGHLY suggest that NFCU conducts an Audit of the Rhode Island Office due to the Loan Officer 's inability to conduct due diligence ; provide timely communications ; reconsider documentation submission priority, as well as the number of applications a Loan Officer can handle for its Members.  seemed overwhelmed throughout the process, even working from home. Oftentimes, he seemed like he didn't know who I was when I would call him. He would state, I'm not at my desk, so I will call you when I get back home. Granted, one time he was sent to the office to pick up the ( Company 's ) mail. ( Who knows, maybe I just kept catching him on his lunch breaks...?! ) Honestly, the interest rate actually dropped to 2.5 % after I locked in- I should be demanding that rate. NFCU Mortgage Loan Originators / Application Decision Makers appear to be partial. I demand that the dropdown to 2.5 % interest rate be honored and that we may proceed with the Refinance in a competent and equitable manner. I am prepared to pay the Appraisal Fee upon If neither the 2.5 % nor the 2.8 % rates will NOT be honored, I will be forced to submit governmental complaints due to inadequate or ineffectual fair lending compliance. However, I do hope that we can resolve this amicably, as I am prepared to pay the Appraisal Fee. 

I look forward to hearing the good news! 

Thank you, .  AM (  hours ago ) to  Thank you . 

I forgot to include a very important detail in my complaint. Please add the following information : // :  stated that for VA  they need all three Credit Bureau reports. 

// : In my phone conversation with , he stated that once he saw my scores he submitted the 2 Credit Bureau reports that he had (  and  ). He further stated that unfortunately for VA loans they need all three. 

My question to him was why would you submit my file with 2 Bureau reports when you need all three ...? He responded by stating that he was under a timeline. 

If that was the case, he should have contacted and communicated that information with me before I had to call him to question the email I received earlier that day ( // ) regarding a Denial Package Reminder. 

Please fwd. 

Thank you. 

Today ( // )  called me to confirm that she forwarded my complaint to her Supervisor responsible for escalations (   ) and Manager, and that I should expect a call today from  today. I received a call from  at  who informed me that he submitted my complaint to the "" Pricing Desk '' who controls interest rates ; and they rejected my request to change my interest rate. He further stated that he will forward my complaint to the previous Loan Officer 's Manager at least for a coaching opportunity. He confirmed that you can actually change ( lower ) your rate 2 times once you lock in a rate - this changed last year. He also confirmed that he is  's Direct Boss and that   is the Branch Manager. He offered me an opportunity to pay a 1 % Origination Fee ( {$1500.00} ) to get my initial locked in rate ( 2.875 % ), but that it would come out of the   that I will receive. 

I informed him of my understanding that they have a way of verifying rates and that I will submit a complaint to every governmental agency responsible for NFCU 's lack of providing and conducting due diligence. 

Background Information : The previous Loan Officer,  , failed to communicate or conduct due diligence in a timely manner. He instructed me to reapply, but my application was reassigned. I'm sure he knew this was going to occur, but lead me to believe he would be able to do a Tri-Merger and proceed with the loan. Also, when I texted him the new Application number, he never responded. However, the following week he confirmed when  called him, that I had already paid the Credit Pull fee. I feel that I received Disparate and Unfair Treatment for several reasons : 1. I did not provide them my race.

2. Due to the Previous Loan Officers failure to meet tasks and misleading me throughout the Application process.

3. The Statement of Denial checked the box, NFCU does not grant credit on the terms requested. It further states on the back, If you have any questions regarding this notice, you should contact : (  )  when you call that number it asks you for a  code, which was not provided, and that is the only option on the call.

However, I received a phone call from an officer at    facilitating my loan today in which he stated SLS had filed an additional complaint to the credit reporting agencies, today, saying I was 120 days delinquent. I didn't find out until     had sold my loan when I went in and spoke to an officer and was informed by him that that was what happened. I was told by him they had mailed a notification of this to the address I lived at when I took out the loan. I haven't lived there for 12 years and they have all my current address and telephone information because I still bank with them. So is    's incompetence my fault? 

I didn't make payments from  to  because I had no idea where to make a payment. Yes, I should have gone to    when that loan disappeared from my accounts. My bad. However, SLS during that time period made no attempt to contact me and they can't say they couldn't get my current address and phone number from   . There are no other companies - mobile phone, power, water, etc ... that wouldn't notify you if you were past due on a bill after a month. This was done deliberately by them, of this I have no doubt, in the hopes they would be able to foreclose on my house.

54,2017-11-17,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"My problem actually begun back in  after my spouse  on   . Immediately I began to get letters from mt them mortgage collector  about foreclosing on my property. My property address       TN, . At that time I was married, My spouse is  now. WE had purchased this home and moved in on   . The cost was {$120000.00} with an interest rate of 8.85 %. We accepted this because we could not get a better deal at the time due to both our credit. And my spouse had his own business and was doing quite well at that time. 

In  I had a company try to help me get the loan modified but the  people would not return the calls from the company called       (  ). The only thing they were able to do was to help get my spouses name removed from the deed and the city and county tax records, in case at a later date I was able to get  to work with me.. Though they continued to send me letters threatening to foreclose, I made my mortgage payments and tried to find a way out. The way out was to refinabnce the property and get out from under . I was unable to get the property refinanced because I had a bankruptcy from . And because of the value of the property versus what was still owed on it. 

So I had an independent appraisal done and discovered the property was only worth {$72000.00} and I still owed {$100000.00}, and I had recommendations to try to get the company to do a loan modifcation,  said no. Said the original owner would not agree. So short sale or deed in lieu, pay it off. I could not pay it off. So the collection attempts continued. 


Anyway before they passed my contract to my current collectors  (    ) in  . I had them to send me a copy of all my payment records, I had only been late once in the 20 years. Which is why I could not understand them trying to foreclose and take my home I was not behind or ever late. But I finally agreed to a Deed in Lieu, and then everything changed when  took over. 

I had already purchased a new home by the time they told me in   that they would not agree to a deed in lieu. I tried to have the realtor who sold me my current home to do a short sale on the property, but my realtor got back to me and said  would not work with them. They asked what should they do. I said nothing I could do. 

Eventually they said we could try to do a deed in lieu. I was bombarded with forms with the same forms to fill out and to send to them. At first their main sticking point was my spouses estate. My spouse had no other heir but me, so his name was removed from the the property. But  insisted on 'paperwork '. Finally after many attempts to get them to accept his  certificate ( They had asked that when I send it in to them the third and fourth times to make sure I put the account number was on the certiciate,. But when I asked specifcally what was wrong with the certificate, why they were not accepting it. I was told by writing on it that made it a voided document ). I sent 7 copies to  of my husbands death cetificate to them and I was only told on    that the issue of the  certicate was resolved. 

Yet we proceeded on with the deed in lieu, And at one time after several people showed interest in buying the property I contacted  gave them the names and information they requested on 2 separate realtors, but no one was ever allowed to work with  toward a short sale. Then back to the deed in lieu because you can not have someone try to short sale if you are working a deed in lieu. So we tried to do a deed in lieu again and I was bombarded with forms to fill out. However when I sent in the forms the main sticking point was my spouses estate. For months I tried to get a lawyer but just could not afford one to get me in court to get the estate probated. Fimnally I was advised to call the court and explain my situation the fact that I could not afford a lawyer and ask if I could get in court. But probate court clerk said the process had been completed, there was nothing else to be done and there would not be a court date. The  people told me at one time they had spoken to my souse and that 's how the knew I was a fraud. Thats why after I finish speaking to them some of the people there do n't want to speak to me again. Anyway the process that had been done is sometimes done when there is only one heir. They told me where I could find information about the type of procedure that had been done on line and give it to . I found the information and sent it to them but since they never acknowledge exactly what they responded too when I 've sent them information. And they never said anything else about it I did not know til now that the issue is resolved. I only found out because they keep calling me sometimes twice a day, they send me uninformative letters sometimes 3 a week. But after contacting the better business bureau the Onbudsman from  did contact me and said at least the issue of my spouse is resolved. But all the forms that I have sent by mail, FAX email and on their site has a shelf life and may have to be done over, I explained that my tax returns form  will not change no mater how long they keep them. And I have filled out so many Form 4506 T, & TEZ for my tax info from the IRS, I can not believe they will send them again. Likewise my income information, All my income is from the Gov., Military Retirement, Military , Civil Service Retirement and Social Security. I have sent them the printed information directly from these agencies and they will not change in a year. This too is harassment. Whatever info on Home Affordable, or HUD forms will not change. The reason I am at this point in my life will not change. I still do n't have anyone who is obligated to help me pay my bills, I am still    and not self employed The only thing that will change is my bank information. If they ask for a copy of a statement on the first I might have {$8000.00}, but on the second or third not so much because I have to pay my bills. So there might be {$1000.00}, but I am not interested in putting one red cent into that property. But effective    I will send them a copy of everything I have signed inlast 60 days every tax form, bank statement and copis of the 10 pages of info I sent on line. Have it copied and ready to drop in the mail as soon as post office opens. By regular mail I caanot afford certified mail just to have them tell me ythe initial on the form does n't belong to anyone who works there. 

Recently (    ) while working on refinancing my new home  was contacted about the amount owed on my property that they are managing,  had my mortgage Co. get me on the phone before they would give them the information. That was fine except while the mortgage company was clearly still on the phone  rep told me that my property was in foreclosure and the date of foreclosure was being sent to me as we spoke. When I asked what about the new deed in lieu we were working on? That I just completed the paperwork online the night before. since the paperwork from   was decided they could not do the deed in lieu. He said 'oh yes I see we have an application ''. So my new mortgage company representative asked that person point blank "" Sir do you have an application on file for the deed in lieu and is that package complete ''. The  representative said 'let me verify ' then came back and said 'yes we have everything we need '. On   I was asked for another hardship letter, a new Request for Assistance form. Thats the last letter I have received but the phone calls keep coming always some scare tactics or just hangup when I answer. 

I am not the first last or only person they have done similar things too. I t seems whenever a loved one passes thats when the problems start. This company should be stopped from the way they are handling cases. I know each case is different but I like every peson they are swindling know their case is individual. They can not or should not be allowed to handle ever case by thhe same standards. I am only concerned about this one my case. Before I moved I was never late or missed a payment with this mortgage from   . I bought another house and can not afford two homes and have no desire to manage a rental property. I have too much invested in that property and do n't want it ruined by a renter. 

I have paid my own insurance and taxes on this property and still pay them now for 22 years and I still owe {$100000.00} I personally paid for a private appraisal before I decided to vacate my property and discovered it 's only worth {$72000.00}, that 's when despite of a {$12000.00} bathroom for  I had put in in  , brand new stove dishwasher and Refrig I put in in  . New Hard wood floors in , security system furnace and Air conditioner. I decided I had to move on. I have been trying to unburden myself with this property actually since my spouse  that 's when they first started to talking about taking my home. Now all I want to do is give it to them and they are harassing me and delaying and checking my credit reports and making sure my credit is ruined and still have not done a thing to move forward.

Yet I can not get a simple, request for verification/proof of insurance. Instead they added insurance coverage and deducted the amount out of payments to Seterus causing a deficit. Imagine my surprise as I spoke with Seterus ' representative. After several days of conversation between Seterus,  and my self, Seterus claimed they had removed the forced placed insurance and sent a check to  ten business days ago. They claimed they refunded my account for insurance payments from the forced placed insurance. When I ask for proof, they "" do not have to provide it to me as I 'm in an active chpt . '' By the way,  has yet to received said payment. Another issue I have with Seterus is I 've been working to refinance my home thru HARP and they have done everything from sending out payoff that expires within  hrs to refusal to provide 30 day payoff, to not giving a payoff that 's long enough for us to close on our loan. They state "" it is against our policy '' to provide what seems to be an industry standard. Escalating in this company is pointless. Everything takes 7-10 business days to get, even if the error was on their part. They continue the same error over and over again and yet bill us each time. It takes them 7-10 business days to process your payment once they received it. Industry standards take 24-48 hrs for any of these type of requests. They never acknowledge anything in writing upon requesting information from them. This company is doing what they want to and always quoting it 's their legal right.

68,2020-12-19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"The mortgage refinance process was probably the worst service experience I have ever had from application to close. I was mislead throughout the process. This is a timeline of events : 1. My first appointment was a disaster - it took over 90 minutes because   ( ""  '' ) didnt know how to do the mortgage application and ended up making me do it TWICE. She told me sob stories about how other customers have yelled at her and I felt sorry for her so I didnt want to complain. 
2. The application paperwork was generated and sent to me via email on //2020 NOT securely these documents contained my FULL Social Security Number among other confidential information. This is a HUGE security risk. 
3. On //2020 I went to the branch to sign the application paperwork and to provide my payment for the Credit Report and Appraisal ( a total of {$500.00} ). I wrote two checks, one for each service. Branch Manager   ( ""  '' ) personally answered a few questions I had on the Loan Estimate document because  was incapable of providing an explanation. The numbers did not make sense to me. There were charges that were not applicable which you explained and I was assured by  many times it was just an estimate and "" it comes off at the end ''. 
4. After about 1 1/2 weeks, I noticed my checks were still not yet cashed. I followed up via phone call because I had not heard from anyone and was concerned there was a problem with said checks. I was called by  and asked to provide new checks because there was a mistake made when depositing the checks and they couldnt be deposited. When I asked what kind of mistake could have possibly caused this,  blamed it on her   and that she couldnt see what she was doing. 
5. On //2020 I requested via phone call and email ( attached ) that the original checks be returned me when I drop off the new checks. It was confirmed in writing the checks would be returned. My mom dropped off the checks without the original checks being returned to me. To date, those checks were NEVER returned to me nor were copies provided to me that showed a deposit attempt. Makes me wonder if those checks were lost/misplaced by someone at Peoples? 
6. Then on //,  personally called me to explain that an internal deadline was not met (  also noted it was 100 % the fault of Peoples Bank ) and an entire new loan application had to be generated and I would need to resign all of the documents. He said this would create a difference in the rate but Peoples Bank would cover the difference. This was very inconvenient and had me doubt the capability of Peoples Bank to handle this process but I was assured everything would be fine going forward as I would not be charged any more than originally quoted. 
7. Weeks went by without hearing a word from anyone at People 's. I went to the branch one Saturday but both  and  were off. When I called  on //2020 she blamed the delay on the mortgage underwriters. 
8. On //2020 I received the Commitment Letter via email which had my address spelled incorrectly. I asked to have it corrected and it was. I also asked why the appraised value of my home was not updated to the official appraised value of {$590000.00} ( email attached ). I was required to pay {$490.00} for an appraisal so the Appraisal Value should be reflected on these loan documents.  assured me the appraisal value would be reflected properly on the Closing Disclosure. 
9. I did not hear from   or anyone for a couple weeks and was worried my loan was lost again. On //, I needed to provide more information which I did so in a timely manner. 
10. I followed up with  on //2020 worried that the closing date would be missed. I was told everything was being sent to the attorney. When she confirmed the documents were sent to the attorney on // she again blamed the delay on the underwriters working from home since //. She assured me that the attorneys office would go over the Closing Disclosure and explain everything to me. I was also concerned that I was being charged too much by the attorney. I had no previous relationship with the attorney. On Day 1 I was told to pick an attorney from a long list the bank used and was told that there would be no additional fee or charge, they all charge the same amount and only charge the bank. Clearly looking at the fees on the Closing Disclosure, misleading and incorrect information was given to me. 
12. On Monday, //, the day of the closing, I had an unaffiliated third-party assist me in reviewing the Closing Document because I did not know why the closing costs were so high, why Section E did not add up, why the appraised value was not reflected and what Lender Credits were. I was surprised to hear that Line Item A. 3 Loan Level Price Adjustment to Peoples United Bank looked to be points as I was under the assumption from Day 1 that there were ZERO points involved in this mortgage. I thought maybe that was the rate difference that Peoples was covering but then the Lender Credits did not completely offset that amount so it did not make sense to me.

13. By early afternoon, I was very concerned about the Closing Disclosure being incorrect and misleading and I decided not to proceed with the closing.

14. Shortly after I stated I would not be moving forward, I received a call from  to discuss the experience and to see if there was anything he could clarify and anything he could do to make me reconsider. After speaking to me twice he clarified that Line Item A. 3 was the difference in rate caused by the mistake that was made by Peoples Bank causing me to complete another application LUMPED TOGETHER with a 1/4 point for not escrowing my property taxes. I was never told ( and dont recalling seeing anywhere in writing ) that I would incur points for not escrowing my property taxes. And why was this lumped together as if to hide it?  told me it was a preference to either pay property taxes/homeowners insurance out of pocket or via escrow. If I knew up front that points were charged for not escrowing the property taxes, then I would have escrowed the property taxes. 
15.  then emailed me on // at  ( attached ) to provide some "" clarifications ''.  included an updated Closing Disclosure which the Appraised Property Value on Page 1 is still the estimated value provided on Day 1, not the appraised value that I paid {$490.00} for. How is it that I was required to pay Peoples Bank {$490.00} ( I asked why the home needed to be appraised in the first place give the amount of equity and I was told I HAD to have it appraised ) to have an person come inside my home during a pandemic to appraise my home and then Peoples Bank never even acknowledged this appraised value on any of my loan documents? Additionally, Section E did still not add up. I also do not see in anywhere in writing that points are charged for not escrowing taxes and it was definitely NOT broken out on the document.

I had every intent to proceed with this loan to get a better rate than I have on my HELOC at People 's Bank and to fund a home improvement project. I provided all required documentation, paperwork and payment in timely manner. However, after all of the experiences listed above, including the misleading and inaccurate Closing Disclosure, I did not feel comfortable closing on this loan. I even thought I was not provided the best rate at the time and it should have been 2.875 %. It is unfortunate that the Closing Disclosure was misleading and inaccurate and my concerns went unaddressed until I notified the parties involved that I would no longer be proceeding with the loan. And then even after that, it still was not never rectified to complete accuracy. And to this day, I still never got a full explanation of what happened with the original checks I provided for the Appraisal and Credit Report Fee and my appraised home value was never used.

The lack of knowledge, training, customer service, transparency and oversight at Peoples Bank is appalling.

I sent an email to the branch manager expressing each of these concerns and resolutions on //2020. I followed up to confirm receipt on //2020 and was told I would hear from the People 's complaint department via phone or email in 1-2 weeks.

It has become a great concern of mine with how I am being handled and ignored by the alleged debt collector, Carrington Mortgage Services. They refuse to abide by federal consumer laws. They blatantly ignore the laws presented to them as if they are beyond the laws. The Fair Debt Collection Protection Act was created by Congress to protect consumers from abusive debt collection practices. Carrington Mortgage Services have invaded my privacy on many occasions. They have ignored the Debt validation letter I sent them on //. They are still sending me communications via the mails. I sent an Affidavit on  , 2021. It was received on  , 2021.

It hasnt stop them from sending mail before. But when I asked for the name and address of the original creditor, now they need a copy of my drivers license. I do not trust this company. I think they will go to great lengths to hide their fraud, not to mention Its a delay tactic. 

Carrington Mortgage Services continue to ignore the federal laws as it pertains to debt, I received ( 6 ) envelopes on the same day with "" A notice to Occupant of Pending Acquisition ''. That is blatant harassment and abusing the debt collection practices. They are nothing more than the servicing agent and have no authority to foreclose.

It is a huge deception to receive payment from the homeowner, and the loan was satisfied 30 days after the closing. Again, it is no longer a loan but it has been converted to a stock. 

I have repeatedly asked for the name and address of the original creditor. They refuse to provide this information. This information will solve the issue. 

I am requesting your assistance in getting this matter resolved. I have attached the Debt Validation letter and the Affidavit for your review.

They asked me to send over proof of payment of taxes along with a letter from myself stating that I pay my own taxes. Both the proof of tax payment and letter were sent immediately to NewRez. I was advised that I should continue paying my normal monthly payment which does not include taxes. In order to make this payment I had to do it over the phone with newrez as I would be paying a lower amount than the statement which incorrectly was including my taxes. My correct payment amount = {$1900.00}. This includes principal, interest and PMI. The statement I received for  had my monthly payment = {$2500.00}. I paid the normal amount of , payment was processed over the phone. 

The following month NewRez sent me a  statement with payment amount = {$3200.00}. They have continued to include tax on my monthly statement even after I have provided proof that my taxes were paid. They simply ignored the fact that I have provided proof of tax payment and continued with adding taxes to my monthly statement. They also carried over an incorrect overdue payment amount from the  statement. On top of all of this they charged me a late fee of . Another fact I learned from my discussions with NewRez is that they paid my taxes but since it was a duplicate payment ( i already paid them ) they received a tax refund from the taxing authority. NewRez continues to keep taxes on my mortgage payment even after received proof of payment from me and a tax refund from the taxing authority I have contacted NewRez again to resolve the issue. They have stated that they are now requesting escrow analysis on the account and that it could take up to a month to get the result of that analysis. Meanwhile I am receiving incorrect monthly mortgage statements and being assessed late fees for paying my correct monthly amount. 

The fact that I have provided NewRez with tax receipts at the moment the discrepancy was noticed and their failure to to take action on it leads me to believe that there is a high level of incompetence or lack of communication internally with this company. NewRez is placing additional burden and stress on me the consumer to constantly contact them and fix my payment even after I have provided them with necessary proof.",Company believes the complaint provided an opportunity to answer consumer's questions,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",CA,92882,,True,Web,2021-12-03,Closed with explanation,True,True,4973511,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['payment', 'statement', 'proof']"

For example, if their existing system is unable to recognize my account information to establish an online account, then why should I have confidence that my payment "" over the phone '' will be applied to the correct account that doesn't exist. 

This business practice needs to be investigated and PNC Bank needs be held accountable for establishing antiquated systems that provide barriers to consumers attempting to make mortgage payments on time ( without penalty ).

2. Why is my statement ALWAYS wrong after I pay the escrow shortage?

6. Why was I blocked from posting on  even though I did NOT use any profanity as suntrust claims?? I simply told the TRUTH about being LIED to. 
7. Why does customer service at suntrust ?? I should not have to file complaints with  different agencies to get customer service and even then I still have not gotten the information I 've repeatedly requested. 
The  at suntrust are still trying to charge me a late fee for my payment in . Thats !!!!

On //2020 I called with several questions re how the Forbearance would work. I was told by the Mr. Cooper agent that the Forbearance covered  thru  at that point and my not being current did not matter, I was now "" protected. '' I was only past due for the  and  payments at that time and concerned about being able to pay before the last day in  to avoid being 90 days delinquent. Again the agent told me not to worry, that Mr. Cooper "" wanted to help during these trying times. '' Throughout my 16 month Forbearance I stayed in contact with Mr. Cooper to plan for what came after my Forbearance ended. For several months I was assured by agents I would be offered a Deferment. On almost every single call, I was given conflicting information from the call before. Transferred to many extensions with those agents confused as to why I had been transferred to them. Many times disconnected after waiting on hold up to one hour or more. Never once was my Single Point of Contact, as listed on mailed correspondence, available to speak with me. 
I've kept very detailed notes with names and dates if these are needed later. 
Although my mortgage is not Federally backed, from the time I was granted Forbearance up until this past // when my Forbearance ended, I was told that Mr. Cooper is "" following the guidelines of the CARES ACT. '' Unfortunately, their following those guidelines ended when my Forbearance ended. I was not only denied a Modification because I was not current on my loan at the onset of Forbearance and because my equity is not low enough, but also denied the Deferment because of not being current. My lender is only offering a Short Sale or a Deed in Lieu. My lender would rather Foreclose on my home of 25 years than to extend Deferment because of 2 past due payments. This is especially hurtful since I had been assured since the beginning by several Mr. Cooper agents that my being behind did not matter. If I had been given accurate information in  of 2020, I would have delayed asking for Forbearance until I could borrow money from family to get current. 
I have sent letters, emails, and Messages through my Mr. Cooper online account asking for help to avoid Foreclosure. I've made suggestions such as my paying a lump sum of the two months I was delinquent in order to be considered for Deferrment. I've asked for a Balloon Payment to be added at the end of my loan. No help is forthcoming. 
Yesterday received an email response to my latest plea for help. It was from a loan executive at Mr. Cooper and again contained misinformation. Most distressing is that in regards to my informing them that on //2020 their agent ( I stated the name, his location and exact words ) told me my not being current did not matter and that the Forbearance covered  thru , the loan executive told me that could not be verified because the phone recordings had been "" purged ''. I responded today by email letting him know I would be filing a complaint with the CFPB. I also included a lengthy account of all the misinformation I'd received from Mr. Cooper and again asked that they contact my lender on my behalf and ask them to work with me to keep my home. 
I am a  year old woman on   . This has been my only home for 25 years. I am extremely stressed and can not eat or sleep much over the thought of losing my home. I am only asking for help and what is fair. Why would anyone Foreclose on a home when someone was not in Foreclosure at the time Forbearance help was offered? 
I have contacted CalHFA and am hoping to be eligible for their HAF program when the Treasury approves the plan they have submitted. Mr. Cooper has informed me that I will start to receive Foreclosure notices after //. I truly hope my lender reconsiders and broadens their guidelines to include everyone who received Forebearance.

 -I am told by   that I will be received {$1400.00} at closing ( electronically if I choose and I will give a voided check to the notary that comes to our home ) and then I will received a separate check for around {$1000.00} in the snail mail 2 weeks after closing. I receive my funds from closing in the amount of {$1800.00} and I made another mortgage payment so I assume yea that's why I got a little back. 
 signed closing documents at our home   It's been 3 weeks since closing and I don't have my {$1000.00} escrow refund check yet but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and wait until next Monday. 
 I call customer service multiple times, hit buttons to get to a person and get hung up on multiple times this goes on for a hour. I reach out to   to see where my escrow refund is and she tells me she doesn't know and there is nothing she can do about it. ( On a recorded line I might add ) I plead for her to email someone or something she works for Mr. Cooper and she tells me no. I then reach out to   and  . I also finally get through to someone at customer service and the first person I speak with tells me that there is no disbursements and my escrow money was rolled over to my new escrow account. I am very upset at this point and get to a escalation specialist by the name of  . She says she will have someone contact me about this. During the waiting I have   call me and tell me "" you are confused. '' I'm not confused because I have email proof from   and know what I was told. Then   calls me and tries to tell me that cash at closing and escrow refund are 1 in the same which is also inaccurate because I was told they are separate and I depend on a mortgage company that is getting paid for a service ( and that I assume I can trust ) to tell me the truth and accurate information. I then reach out to a executive assistant by the name of   to try and reach the leadership for the company that is listed on their website.

I did not get one reply from anyone in leadership at all. 
 -I received a call from   who reports her title is Assistant VP over the sales department. She proceeds to tell me nothing wrong has been done and she has reviewed my case and I can filed a complain with CFPD but nothing will be found there as well. How she knows the future is beyond me but here I am filing the complaint anyway. I truly can not believe this company is able to get away with lying to their customers.

274,2019-08-24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"During the 2nd week of //, I received my annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement. Since this is the first year with Loancare as my mortgage servicer, this is the first time they have provided me this letter.

On the Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement, it was noted that I had an escrow surplus of {$150.00}. In other words, I had paid more into escrow than was necessary. As such, Loancare issued me a check for {$150.00}.

Also on the Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement, my semiannual property ( county ) tax disbursements were listed. I own two parcels. For one of the parcels, the semiannual property tax disbursement transferred identically from // to //, which is accurate. For the second parcel, a rear, half acre parcel on which there is no structure, no improvement, no change, Loancare noted that my semiannual tax disbursement would increase from {$67.00} to {$1300.00}. This equates to a difference of {$2600.00} for the year! As a result, my monthly escrow payment increased from {$590.00} to {$770.00}. This is almost {$200.00} more per month.

When I noticed this issue in early //, I began calling Loancare. At the time, they said that this issue would be fixed by //. It is now // and I have had to make two mortgage payments that are almost {$200.00} more per month than I had planned. I did not budget for this.

To date, I have called Loancare 7 times. I have sent them 3 emails via their customer service contact email address. I have received no response to any of the emails - either by phone, email, or mail. During those calls and within those emails, I have discussed the Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement, I have provided a link to my county auditor 's page for the parcel in question, I have provided the phone number to my county auditor, and I have explained the situation clearly and thoroughly. I don't know what more I could do - I've basically done their job for them, and yet they have taken no action on their end.

Today, I was told that this process may take another month or more. Simply put, I don't have the money to continue to make monthly payments that are {$200.00} more than they are supposed to be.

I don't know if Loancare is simply negligent ( i.e., they don't care about their customers at all ) or fraudulent ( they hike escrow payments in the hopes that borrowers default on their mortgages ), but something is amiss. This is the 6th property I've owned, and I have NEVER experienced a single issue with a mortgage servicer until now.

Please investigate Loancare.

I called to discuss my options on refinancing the home. After a discussion on loan balance on my primary and secondary and home value, it was told to me that I did not qualify to refinance. I then asked what my options were if the loan matured and what would happen. The representative said she could not help as she only handled refinances and would need to transfer me to Customer Service. I spoke to the Customer Service representative and she then said she could not handle and would need to transfer me to a loa n specialist. After reviewing my situation with the specialist she could not help me and said that my only option was to speak to the loan modification specialist. I then spoke to the loan modification specialist and she explained that i  would need t o apply for the loan modification and depending on my case it may or may not be approved. She advised me to wait until my loan matures which is 1 year away. I told her I did not  want to wait as I wanted to work with the bank to get this resolved now and discuss my options. I could not qualify for the refinance because my house would not appraise at the value to meet a 90 % loan to value threshold. She indicated that the loan modification application would be mailed to me. She said it would take    days to bet processed but did warn me that if I accepted the modification that it would impact m y credit score.      What surprises me is that I have been a customer for 20 years wit h US Bank and h ave been in good standings throughout that timeframe.

Last week I discovered that Chase failed to pay my home owners insurance annual premium, FROM THE ESCROW ACCOUNT THAT IS AT ISSUE IN MY PRIOR COMPLAINT, when I got a text from my insurance company telling me that my policy would lapse at  that night if not paid. 

When I called Chase, I was asked to confirm that  was my current carrier. I advised them that there had been no change and was puzzled as to why it was not PAID if they KNEW who the insurance carrier was. I was not given any type of answer. I was however advised that it was likely not paid because the insurance company had the WRONG ADDRESS. When in fact, Chase had the wrong address. Chase has the mailing and property address FOR THE PROPERTY THAT IT IS THE MORTGAGE HOLDER ON. Chase has    ,   NEVADA . When in fact the property address is    , , NV . How is this? I was then advised that this was likely "" the address that was on the original loan documents. '' I advised that was incorrect. My prior mortgage holder had the correct address on file and the documents would never have recorded correctly to transfer ownership. I was then transferred at least 4 times wherein the representatives could not understand that Chase has the wrong address. I was asked to send in tax documentation to confirm the property address and the parcel ID #. I refused - it is not my problem. I have attached a PDF print out of the  County Assessors office supporting my assertion that Chase has no idea what they are doing. 

This has got me believing that Chase likely does not have a correct or accurate copy of my loan documents. I mean, if they did, they would know the correct property address, right? 

Lastly, I continue to get calls in response to my prior CFPB complaint which seem to miss the point. My concern is not regarding the payment of my special district taxes - DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT NOT PART OF MY ORIGINAL LOAN AGREEMENT. My problem is that Chase is apparently unwilling to allow me to make a deposit into my escrow account ( WHICH IS VOLUNTARY AND MY MONEY TO BEGIN WITH ) and the reassess or re-evaluate my escrow account as to any "" projected shortage '' that may occur over the next year ... so that once that is done, my monthly payment will not increase. Chase apparently does not care what is in my original loan documents, what would be a "" Courtesy '' for its customers ( I have never asked for a courtesy revaluation of my escrow account with Chase and I believe that I am entitled to ask for that, in writing, in the event that I do not agree with the projection. ) This is not rocket science, but common courtesy.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NV,89044,,True,Web,2018-10-09,Closed with explanation,True,True,3041268,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['chase', 'address', 'escrow']"

In //, our mother passed away and it became an extreme hardship for my brother and I. As of //, we had made payments in excess of {$750000.00}. We understand that most of that was interest because of how the loan is amortized. We went to Ocwen Loan Servicing and told them we wanted to do everything we could to keep our family investment as it was the right thing to do and we had so much already invested. We were told to file for a loan modification. We filled out all the paperwork right away and it took over a year for them to receive everything they needed. They kept telling us they didn't receive documents even though we sent the documents certified mail. They would tell us one page was missing which was not the case because we scanned everything into one PDF and also emailed the files so if they received one page they received all the pages. The house at the time of loan modification application was appraised by a realtor ( comp basis ) of {$720000.00} but our balance was ~ {$840000.00}. They would not accept payments during the application process but they added late fees and penalties every month. Now they tell us we owe over {$960000.00} after paying for 10 years on an original note of {$990000.00} we only get credit for {$25000.00}. We purchased the house for {>= $1,000,000} so we had a $ {$330000.00} home equity line of credit on my parents primary residence which we had to sell at the time of my mother 's passing in order to pay off this debt. My brother and I now owe this to our remaining  siblings in order to buy them out of my parents share. The original monthly mortgage amount that was paid for 10 years was {$6200.00} without escrow. We paid our property taxes and insurance on our own. We made all these payments on time until both of our parents passed away. After 14 months from the date of application for the loan modification Ocwen Loan Servicing gave us a trial 3 month payment plan. We asked for the terms and they refused to give them to us. They said you make these payments and then we will calculate your final modification. We made the 3 payments of {$6300.00} and then received the final modification to sign. They reduced the interest rate from 6.5 % to 4.125 % and left the maturity date the same. They started the loan over so we lost the benefit of having already paid the first 10 years of an amortized loan which is when the most interest is paid. They also added a balloon payment in the amount of {$430000.00} at the end of the 18.5 years. We were not aware of the balloon payment until after we made all our trial payments. I had to argue with them because the first payment for the trial payment was applied to the previous balance and not to the trial plan payments. We had over 50 calls during this process and it was never clear about what they were doing to help us. We told them that we would do anything they needed for us to keep our home but we could not keep paying at these rates. They told us we had 5 options : 1 ) Foreclosure, 2 ) Short sale ( they would accept under {$700000.00} ), 3 ) Accept the loan modification with the balloon payment, 4 ) Make payments at 6.5 % and over the next 11 months the payments would be over {$18000.00} per month to catch the loan up and then it would be caught up and we would pay {$7000.00} per month for the remaining 18.5 years, 5 ) Pay the remaining balance in one installment. We explained to them that we are applying for the loan modification because we are in distress. We feel that they have been deceiving all along. We paid the full flood and hazard insurance out of pocket yet they added those amounts into the past amounts owed because they thought they paid them. We sent them proof from our insurance company and showed cancelled checks and they still kept those payments on our debt. It is unbelievable how bad they have treated us. We have done everything we can to keep our home and will continue to do so. Right now they said they will not accept payments from us until we sign the loan modification agreement but it will be like starting over when we have already paid over {>= $1,000,000} which includes what we owe on the other equity loan. We are good people that have always worked hard and did the right thing. All we are trying to do is to keep our family investment that we made almost 12 years ago with our parents that are now both deceased. We are asking for help to require Ocwen Loan Servicing to treat us fairly so we can keep our home. We are upside down on this house. We have told them we are willing to continue to pay for the next 18.5 years but we need the terms to change. We were requesting the principal balance be reduced to what they said they would accept on a short sale which is ~ {$680000.00}, the interest rate to be reduced to 3 % which they alluded to when we applied, and allow the loan to be on year 12 of the amortization schedule so the high interest payments don't start over. They told us if they short sale it then they would accept less than {$700000.00} ( they mentioned {$680000.00} ). All we are asking is that we get the same opportunity that a new person could come in and just get without any previous investment since we have so much invested already and have the desire to pay the loan.

My real estate agent   advised me not to pursue forbearance because it may give the false impression that I am breaching my sales contract. I have every intention of selling my home as soon as possible. I would like to know whether a temporary forbearance for 2-4 months maximum would create an obstacle to the sale of my home, such as potential miscalculations of mortgage fees, interest and/or penalties, at settlement.

These statements advise me of any escrow account shortage. My // ( Exhibit 3 ) escrow review statement showed a shortage of only {$270.00}. The following year 's statement dated // ( Exh. 2 )  showed an escrow shortage of {$550.00}. However, my most recent statement ( Exhibit 1 ), dated //, inexplicably shows a shortage of a whopping {$2900.00}. 
A review of the escrow statements reveal that these shortages are based on "" projections '' ( page 2 of exh. 1 ). However, as page 3 of Exh. 1 shows, the projection formula is based on "" what [   ] expects to pay out. '' I have no idea how these year-to-year projection expectation amounts are determined, though I suspect that the increase is linked to a claim I made in . A neighbor whose rear yard abuts mine was working on his car in his rear yard and apparently did not have the vehicle properly braced. It consequently crashed through his rear fence, descended down the hill, crashed into the rear of my property, causing severe damage to the exterior and interior of my home. I have been using   through Wells Fargo as my escrow manager for over fifteen years without ever having to make a claim. I can only surmise that the huge increase in my escrow "" projection '' of what is expected to be paid out is somehow correlated to my damage claim which was not my fault. 
I am asking for an explanation from Wells Fargo and/or   as to how this exorbitant increase in escrow projection was determined. As I have observed, it appears to be correlated to my claim which goes against the basic tenet of insurance, which is to spread risk among the company 's insured so that no one is hit with a menacing escrow shortage in the event of a needed claim. 
Exhibit 1, page 3, shows that {$950.00} was paid to   County Revenue Department for my annual  property tax bill, so it is impossible to reconcile why my escrow account must be as high as {$2900.00} from {$550.00} the previous year. 
Additionally, I am asking for an explanation over the "" ESC REFUND '' indicated at the // line of Exhibit 1 page 3, as I do not recall receiving a refund, nor was I told that any refund was applied to the principal of my mortgage.

I 'm enclosing the market analysis that was done on the house less then a year ago, by a real-estate agent, when I was looking into selling the house, he was not payed by me for the analysis.The house value now is -. So at this point I 'm stuck, the value of the house is too low to sale and pay off the mortgage, and the monthly mortgage payments with 6 % interest are unendurable. 
For the last 17 years I have seen my mortgage principle increase regardless of the timely monthly payments that I made for years. When my mortgage was with   over 10 years ago, I made additional payments and asked the bank, to apply it into the principal but it was never applied, I received notices that "" I over payed, therefore I do not need to make payments for the next 2-3 month ''. I could see that my principle kept on increasing and was not able to do anything about it, the bank refused to make any arrangements to stop that trend. 

My hardship started prior to 2013 when my employer, in order to save money, decreased our working hours, after several month of receiving lower income it became apparent that I will not be able to keep up with the mortgage payment of {$1600.00} a month, I called Wells Fargo and asked for help.

I had to find another job with a higher income in order to be able to make the mortgage payments!

However after several month of working with that new company, the owner announced that the company is being sold, and he is "" letting people go ''! I was one of the newest employees, therefor I was among the first employees that the company "" let go ''. 
I received unemployments benefits and therefore was told by Wells Fargo that I 'm not qualified for modification, however my monthly payments were reduced to {$800.00} a month for a year. I had no problem making these payments but I was surprise to find out that additional fees and interest were added, therefore my principle has being getting higher during that period. 
Unfortunately, while looking for another job, I was experiencing some health problem that required surgeries and treatments. I applied and was awarded social security . I had  in the past 18 month . I have been in treatments and physical therapy for the past two years and my health has been improving slowly, I 'm planning on getting back into the workforce as soon as I recover from the upcoming .

At the beginning of my request for a refinancing, I asked whether AmeriSave would make a loan for a property held in trust. The answer was "" yes ''. 

After my submission of approximately  pages of documentation and payment of a {$570.00} fee, AmeriSave refused to close the loan unless I took the loan out of the trust. ( It should be noted that a copy of the trust was submitted very early on in the process. ) AmeriSave gives as a reason for refusal the fact that although the property is now held in trust as indicated in the title, the title lists only me as trustee whereas the trust also has my wife as a trustee. The said they would close the loan only if I took the property out of trust. AmeriSave 's bad faith reasoning is bogus, as can be demonstrated by the following : 1. A major bank refinanced this property several years ago with the exact same documentation and found no problem. The instrument used was the a standard  document. 
2. Based on a suggestion by an attorney, I offered - at my expense - to have the second trustee put on the title. This would have cured the problem cited by AmeriSave, but they still refused to close the loan. 

I should point out that my reasons for not taking the property out of trust are two-fold. First, added expense. Second, mortgage notes prohibit the change of title without lender approval so I could not put the property back into the trust without AmeriSave approval. Based on their past performance, I can not take a chance that they would not permit my putting the property back into the trust. 
Summing up : AmeriSave has acted capriciously and in bad faith. Their condition for closing the loan is not according to early assurances and, furthermore, is unreasonable based on previous history by another lender as well as the refusal to agree to a simple approach suggested by my attorney which, cures the problem they cite.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,AMERISAVE MORTGAGE CORPORATION,FL,32082,Older American,True,Web,2016-07-12,Closed with explanation,True,True,2007948,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['trust', 'property', 'title']"

I've been working with Better Mortgage on a mortgage application ; however, they have not been able to get anything right. They are either fraudulent or grossly incompetent/negligent. I will be filing a detailed report in the near future including all communications with the company and the misconduct. In the meantime, I'm wondering if there is any steps the CFPB can take to help get this loan closed. Most recently, Better Mortgage is refusing to provide a closing disclosure that has correct numbers on it. I provided them with the errors that needed to be fixed on the closing disclosure, but rather than just fixing the errors, they are insisting that I sign an erroneous document. The text of my most recent email ( sent on Friday evening //21 ) to the company is as follows : I hope you are aware of the implications of trying to force me to sign an erroneous closing disclosure. You are in violation of multiple regulations both at the federal and state (   PA  ) levels by even suggesting such. I see no indication that you have any intention of providing a closing disclosure that has correct numbers on it. The fact that these specific errors were brought to your intention but you refuse to provide a corrected document may even be criminal behavior. Based on an initial assessment, it's fraud. 

Throughout this process, Better has fabricated their own "" rules '' contrary to what is stated in the federal regulations. When I pointed out that Better is incorrect based on what is stated in the regulations, you simply fabricated another "" rule '' to try to cover the lie. For anything I disagreed with, I provided you with regulatory citations indicating the actual requirements. When I asked you to provide regulatory references to your bogus claims, you were unable to do so. I provided you with the EXACT errors on the closing disclosure that needed to be changed. This should have taken all of ~ 20 minutes. A period of days have elapsed since I provided you with these errors. Instead of just making the corrections, you wrote email after email pressuring me to sign a falsified document. 

As  just brought you in on this application, I want to make sure we're both clear on the events taking place. If you have any intention of salvaging this deal, I urge you to make the corrections to the closing disclosure immediately. If you fail to do so, I'll take that as confirmation that it was your intention all along to mislead the consumer and that you never were willing to provide the services quoted at the quoted price.

536,2018-02-16,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"My mortgage is a 10 fixed / 30 year mortgage. It was originally serviced through  /   (   ) where they allowed me to set up bi-weekly payments that were withdrawn automatically from my account. After the 10 year term was over, my mortgage was transferred to SLS Mortgage. I asked to set up the bi-weekly payment ( where my mortgage would essentially be split in 1/2 and i would pay 1/2 my payment on the // and the remaining 1/2 balance at the each of each month - similar to what i had set up with / ). SLS advised that they would need to charge me to set this up so i set this up with my bank instead. I paid  on the // and  the // of month. Recently my mortgage went up slightly due to escrow increases due to my homeowners so this amount has slightly changed. Since my mortgage was transferred to SLS, i have had continuous issues when i call in on a monthly basis to have both my payments made ( the  and  combined and removed from their suspense account ) to be applied to my current payment due date - of which i am never late. I have been calling in monthly since my loan was transferred which has now been perhaps 2 years. Over the course of this time, they have taken some of my payments ( either  or  and applied to principal which i have asked them to reverse ) but in some cases they have told me that they can't and i would need to pay another similar amount in order to not be considered late on my payment. They have also started charging me late payments and when i ask them why, they have repeated stated that they will continue to charge me late payments ( even though i am paying on time ) simply because i am paying partial amounts and they will continue to do so until i change my method of payment to pay once monthly since their system is unable to support my payment style. Can someone please look into this concerning matter. In the beginning of my mortgage transfer, i had them note my account that i would be paying separate payments. I call in every month to have my payments reconciled and have had several agents tell me on the phone that my payments have been applied correctly only to find out that the agents processing my payments have still not processed my payments correctly where some of my payments are going to principal. Lastly, once my 10 year arm was expired, i called customer servicer and was told that my mortgage payment would increase to 2800ish that would include my estimated escrow. My mortgage increased dramatically and when i attempted to resolve with them, they stated that they would not go back and review calls made to reconcile whether the increase was accurate - i called several times during a course of perhaps at least 6 months on this issue. Any assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated. 

A fair resolution would be the following : 1 - reverse all late payments since i have not been late, i have always paid on time and it is SLS who has misapplied my payments and at times even forced me to pay part of mortgage again. 

2 - allow me to continue to pay my mortgage split into 2 payments which are always paid on time.

3 - transfer my mortgage to another actual bank that can support my payment style.

4 - have SLS confirm that my rate increase from 1 1/2 years ago was accurate, i believe that the increase is incorrect based on what i was communicated by the customer servicer agent that gave me my estimated payment increase that included escrow.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Specialized Loan Servicing Holdings LLC,VA,20143,,True,Web,2018-02-16,Closed with explanation,True,True,2816807,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['mortgage', 'payment', 'pay']"

Nothing was ever indicated that I could possibly lose my home if I opted to take the moratorium during the initiation of the partial claim process of this loan. PNC made it seem as though I would be able to get back on track once the moratorium ended. It was never indicated or mentioned that foreclosure was an option.

Rocket Mortgage shouldn't show the balance of the second in the total  on their website and in their statements, but then choose not to do so on payoffs ( citing that the second is serviced by  and owned by HUD ).

635,2017-11-09,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"I applied for my first mortgage against a home in   of . This was the first mortgage I had applied for, and the first mortgage that was going to be placed against my home. I needed to do some home renovations and updating. I filled out the application online with Regions Bank. I had  existing accounts and a credit card with them, and had zero problems with them prior to this. 
I applied for a home equity load and within the week, and my fiance and I went into one of the local branches off bernedette to sign the application paperwork so I could get the process beginning. I had been preapproved for {$40000.00}, had a credit score of almost  on my transunion report and a flawless payment history. I was told there was about {$80000.00} in equity in my home, the title was clear, and elected to take out a loan for {$35000.00}. I looked over the application and noticed it was for a home equity line of credit, and questioned this with the "" personal banker ''  . He said that a HELOC and home equity loan applications were the essentially, same process ect. He said the difference included a variable interest rate, that I did n't have to take out the full amount all at once and the draw/payment process. He said that at any time I could roll it over into a traditional home equity loan with a fixed rate and structured payment set. I signed and was out of the office in 10 minutes. He did n't give me a time frame on the amount of time it would take but a rough estimate of 3-4 weeks. So I waited. 
After 4 weeks, I had herd nothing from them so I called the  number for online applications and inquired. I was told that I was approved pending paperwork, and was told that the local branch would be in contact with me to process this. I schedule some concrete work that needed to be done before winter came, assuming that I was approved. After another 2 weeks, now 6 weeks after applying, I still had herd nothing on signing the paperwork so I called again. Initially, they could n't find an application on me at all. I called the following day again and did some checking, they researched it, found it, and had me contact a loan  at a different local branch in town off  . I called and scheduled a time to meet a day or 2 later. When I met him, he explained to me that the previous banker that had helped me sign paperwork was let go a week or so after I had gone in to sign paperwork. He already knew that I had been approved, it was just pending signing paperwork and with the shuffle of terminating the previous employee, my paperwork got lost. I explained that I had been waiting over 6 weeks and needed to get some work done on the exterior before it got too cold outside to do it. He told me to take out a personal loan, and then when the paperwork for the home equity loan went through that they would just pull money from that to pay back the personal loan and it would n't adversely affect my credit. I agreed to the personal loan. and he said he would be in touch with me in the next day or two to sign home equity loan paperwork. By the end of the week I had n't herd anything back. I contacted again the local branch off  again, he said he would check into it and call me back. 
The following week he called and said that the only loan  that was available for me to sign had lost his daughter and wife in an accident the prior week, but the loan  was going to come into the office on bernedette that day to sign paperwork with us. I met him over my lunch break went in and waited to meet. We sat for and waited almost an hour before he called us back to his office. He had the paperwork sat out told us to look over it, initial and sign where it was highlighted. He was stoic, and did n't ' explain much of anything. We asked about an insurance and taxes on the house he said we had to pay the insurance but the taxes would be paid out of the loan. We asked about the refinancing and said that we could refinance and take out more if needed, and as long as it was with regions there would n't be any charge backs for closing costs. We signed he said we had 72 hours to call and cancel, but then followed up that if we did cancel, we would be responsible for the {$8000.00} personal loan to be paid back in full by the end of the month. 
We ended up needing to use almost the entire balance of the HELOC to do the remodel, I started to get tax notices in the mail that needed to be paid. I called in  about the tax notices, they said that it sometimes happens with new loans that the address does n't get updated and the notices get sent to us She gave us an address and a fax number to send them to and told us it would be taken care of and if we got anymore to just forward them on. My fiance had an accident at the end of  and we had to get a new vehicle. In , we found out we had to pay sales tax on the new vehicle, I wanted to refinance my credit cards and we needed to finish renovations, so I called to refinance the heloc. I was told that I had to wait 6 months before reapplying for the finance. I though this was strange that I had to reapply as I was told I I could just refinance with no problems, but waited a couple of weeks to apply again. I called again a couple of weeks later to apply, did so over the phone and was denied. And was told it was because heloc was so new and not established yet. I was let go from my job about 4 weeks later in   of . I scraped, not once falling behind on any of my bills and finally was able to regain employment the end of . I decided then try reapplying with another company,  loans in . I filled out my application, and spoke with them. They denied me because I had n't been with my employer for at least 6 months ... 
In  of , I recieved a notice that my house was going to be put up for Tax Auction later that year in  for nonpayment of taxes. So I called regions to figure out what was going on. The representative told me that I was responsible for the taxes and insurance on the home and that with any HELOC, there is not an escrow nor did the bank pay them because they 're placed as  mortgages on the home. And the primary mortgage had the escrow account that paid the taxes and Regions was n't responsible. I explained that it was the only mortgage on the home, and there was n't a primary she said it did n't matter and suggested refinancing it into a traditional mortgage. I waited the 6 months like quicken had said to do and in  of , I needed to get some of my debts consolidated and pay the almost {$2000.00} in back property taxes now owed. My   was dropping and refinancing looked to be the best option to relieve this. 
I called Regions again to refinance, explained the situation and was sent to the    department. I told him my situation, that I needed to refinance the , get my credit cards paid off and explained the tax situation. I asked for an additional {$10000.00} on top of the {$32000.00} for the credit card debt and taxes. He told me that it should n't be a problem, with over half the equity still available and he could help. That it should n't take long for the credit report to come back and for him to speak with the loan officers on staff, and I waited on hold. He then came back on the line, and said that I had been denied, that my revolving balances on my credit accounts, including the regions HELOC was too high, and my income of {$40000.00} a year and credit score of  was too low to refinance. I panicked. 
In  I saw a commercial for an FHA backed refinance that was suppose to be for people with lower credit scores and income. I called  , explained the situation, and they claimed they would be able to help. Went through all the paperwork and they order an appraisal of the house. I waited about  weeks after applying and getting the paperwork for the appraisal, and he came out and accessed.   came back after the appraisal that there was an unfinished bathroom, some places where drywall needed to be repaired and the house needed flooring, all in all about {$6000.00} total to finish the work before they could proceed. I did n't have any way to finish the repairs so I canceled the refinance. 
Shortly after canceling the refinance, I received another notice of the tax auction paperwork and called regions corporate office in  of . I explained my situation to a lady in the department that deal 's exclusively with properties up for tax auction. I explained my story from beginning to end to her. She apologized over and over again for the situation Regions had put me in and decided to talk to somebody higher up to see what we could get done. 
I was contacted in  by  , a regional  for the  's in my area. He had gotten the complaint and wanted to meet with us to make sure he understood everything right. I called and explained the situation of what happened and he elected to meet with us. We met with him   at a local branch off . We once again explained the situation from beginning to end, and he apologized for all of the trouble we 've been having and wanted to see what he could do to make things right. The only thing we asked for was a refinance with cash out to pay off some debts so I could get my finances back under control. They were spiraling out and I did n't know what else to do. He mentioned that he recalled the loan  losing his family, and the one employee being let go. He said that the HELOC 's are handled by a different part of Regions all together. There was a  Mortgages and a Regions Bank. The HELOC was through the bank, and it should have been a home equity loan through the mortgage side. He said the only hangup now was the minimum  being required on my credit score. He had us meet with a mortgage office,   at the location off burnedette who pulled my credit score and it was at . He said there was n't anything he could do but he would relay the information on to  and he would be in touch.  called the following day and said that we needed to get some of the credit card debt paid down. That would bounce my credit score past the  to refinance. He said he could n't do any form of debt consolidation loan for us and refereed us to a gentleman at   giving us his name and number. 
I contacted onemain in  of  and got a plan together to get my credit cards paid down through a loan with them. We took out {$6000.00}, enough to pay the taxes and half my credit card debt, and paid them down. I took out the loan thinking it was going to be a short term loan and would turn around pay it off with the refinance. I waited for my credit scores to bounce back, and in  of  I contacted  again. He had me meet with  as before and I filled out another application. I was denied again, this time because my credit score on my equifax report was . My transunion report showed  and experian showed , but the mean score was just below what they said was required. This still baffles me because this was shortly after it was released that equifax had the huge data breech. None of my accounts had updated on equifax since the Spring. I had also found a new job with a starting salary of {$48000.00} and still have perfect payment history. 
On top of all this, I 've had to call   since  of  because they keep billing me for an 90 day insurance policy costing {$1600.00} on my home. My homeowners insurance has never lapsed and I 've been continuously insured since I got the home in  of . I have faxed the paperwork as has my insurance agent. They will take it off, and then I see it charged again the following month. 
I 'm at a loss now as what to do ... I fear for losing my home as I 'm struggling to make ends meet as is. I did everything I was suppose to do, listened to what each representative from Regions was telling me to do followed through with what they were suggesting. Now on top of everything I have an additional {$270.00} a month loan payment with the additional credit card payments and the heloc. I was n't budgeting for all these, because it was suppose to be paid off They threatened in  to close my credit card account, that of which has never been past due for a payment and only at 50 % credit utilization. It 's my longest open credit card account and would have damaged my credit every further had it been closed. I had to fight and fight to get them to keep that open. 
Bottom line, I followed the rules and researched, applied for a home equity loan, took the advice from the banker under the impression that it could be rolled over into a traditional home equity loan at any time with no problems. I was explained nothing by the mortgage office, who in my opinion should n't have been allowed to sign any paperwork with anybody under his personal circumstances, and pressured to not to reconsider under the 72 hours reconsideration time frame because of the personal loan I had taken out. I was told that the property taxes were going to be taken care of and they have n't been. Even after finding out I had to reapply, I tried reapplying 4 different times over the course of 18 months, but was denied because of the factors directly related to the HELOC. Called corporate and met with a regional  who apologized for everything and wanted to make things right. Followed his advice, took out a different loan that I 'm now stuck with because, yet again, I was lied to and told incorrect information.

The phone tree for this mortgage servicer makes it extremely difficult to get through to an agent for insurance escrow purposes. Once you go through the prompts for escrow purposes and select the insurance option, you are sent through a complicated maze of options with no option for a truly "" none of the above '' option. The first set of prompts provides a "" none of the above '' option, but this set of options also provides only three options, none of which also applied to me. I pushed zero to try to get through to an agent, and it said this was an invalid entry and that I had to push another button to go back to the previous menu, which again had options none of which applied to me. All I wanted to do was check in with the agent regarding the status of my insurance change, and had to wait over six minutes just to get through the convoluted maze of options to speak to someone. This is inappropriate and needs to change. When I tried to submit a complaint regarding this issue once I finally got through to someone, the agent said she could not take a complaint, and I had to submit a complaint to the customer service department. She proceeded to transfer me over to this customer service department, which again transferred back to the phone tree where I could not reach anyone.

In the same denial letter, they said my current housing expenses is less that equal to  % of my gross income ( meaning that I make too much money?? ) Again I am at a loss.

As a result of the previously filed complaint, Cardinal Financial has extended an approved forbearance offer to the borrower in writing. However, the letter the borrower received has conflicting information. 

First, the cover letter dated //, advised "" to the extent possible, please sign and return the attached Agreement within fourteen ( 14 ) days of receiving this offer ''. 

This was inconsistent with the letter from   , Specialist with Cardinal Financials Loss  Department.   's letter states "" To accept our offer of FHA FORMAL FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT please call the number listed below to indicate your acceptance no later than // '' The FHA FORMAL FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT gives the borrower a deadline to send in the signed agreement by //. This is inconsistent with the // dated letter from Cardinal Financials Loss  Department, and with    's // dated letter. 

Additionally, the FHA FORMAL FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT has language that is unclear and contradictory. Specifically, under the "" Agreement '' section, it states : "" A ) Mortgagor ( s ) agree ( s ) to an APPROVED FHA FORMAL FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT WITH NO MONTHLY PAYMENTS FROM // THRU //. THESE PAYMENTS MUST BEGIN //, AND ON THE  OF EVERY MONTH THEREAFTER THROUGH // ... '' I contacted Cardinal Financial Company and initially spoke with a representative who also reviewed the paperwork. The representative advised it appears the letter has a typo, but unfortunately Cardinal is unable to correct the document and the borrower must sign as is. I asked if the borrower can simply call and confirm she wants to accept the agreement, I was told no this would not be possible. I asked to escalate this case and ended up speaking with supervisor,  ( ID :  ). 

  ( ID : SAN ) acknowledged borrowers concern with the language but refused to admit to any typo and said that this was simply a template, it can not be corrected, and borrower must sign and submit form as is or she will not be approved for a forbearance. 

SUMMARY OF COMPLAINT Cardinal Financial Company sent the borrower mailed correspondence with three separate items : A // dated letter from their loss mitigation department, indicating the borrower has 14 days to submit the signed agreement; A // dated letter from    with the loss mitigation department advising the borrower they must call to indicate acceptance by // ; And the // "" FHA FORMAL FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT '' that states i. ) the borrower must send the signed form back to Cardinal to accept the forbearance by //, and ii. ) the FHA FORMAL FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT has language that states payments will be due from the borrower during the forbearance agreement.

662,2021-12-09,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"Synopsis : We are requesting help retaining our home of 24 years. It is being threatened with foreclosure after our  forbearance became due immediately. We assert our mortgage servicer, Specialized Loan Servicing ( SLS ) and the investor,     , were deceptive by not providing clear and transparent information that   forbearance, a lump sum ( {$56000.00} ) was our only home retention option. We do not have anywhere near that amount and SLS has not given us any reasonable means to avoid foreclosure. Before forbearance we were current on our payments and never would have entered into  related forbearance if we had known a lump sum was the only resolution- we would have sought other options. Also, we were told we were evaluated and then reassured that there were other retention options during the 18-month forbearance. 


We have until // to make our account current or SLS will begin accelerated foreclosure and we will also be responsible for legal costs. If we didnt know better, we would think SLS and the       taking advantage of the pandemic to force us out of our home. We want to stay in our house and are willing to work together with SLS and the investor on any affordable options to prevent foreclosure. 

Detail : In // due to the  pandemic we had a reduction in household income. At the time we were current on our mortgage payments. I contacted SLS and inquired about forbearance and the terms. SLS stated they evaluated our account and it was given ( Exhibit A ). I never filled out an application or received any legal documentation describing any conditions or qualifications. With the continuation of  I extended the three-month forbearance six times and at each extension SLS claimed to evaluate our account before each extension ( Exhibit A ). 

I was concerned about the impact of forbearance and during the 18 months contacted SLS frequently asking about  options available ( Exhibit B ). The only letter I received indicating a lump sum was due at the end of forbearance was dated // ( Exhibit A, page  ) ; all the other extensions never mention this. In // before the end of the first forbearance, I was reassured by SLS agents that lump sum was not the only option and not to be concerned as almost always the deficit could be resolved with an affordable option and they would work with us. No documentation I received ever stated lump sum could be the only retention option. 

Forbearance ended on // and I was prepared and able to resume making monthly payments. On // I applied for loan mitigation assistance as instructed by SLS. Assistance was denied ( Exhibit C ) on //. SLS claimed the mortgage was at the loan modification limit according to investor guidelines. I had no indication this was a possibility and was shocked that we were being forced to give up our home unless we could come up with {$56000.00}. We do not have anywhere near this amount available. SLS offered short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure. We do not want to give up our home so these were not viable options for us. 

I requested an independent review on // and got the same response. In the appeal letter ( Exhibit D ) I stated that I was never informed about investor rules and was constantly told by SLS agents there were other options than a lump sum. The appeal was denied by SLS on // and communicated in a letter dated // ( Exhibit  ). In the rejection SLS stated "" ... a complete loss mitigation application was needed to evaluate the account for all available options. '' ( Exhibit  ). In effect SLS and the investor would not have told me this modification limit until I applied for a loan modification. However, this ""  '' requires that I go through forbearance to know my financial situation before I could apply for loss mitigation and only then find out there were no realistic retention options. 

I do not think the investor rules were difficult for SLS to discern and notify us. At each forbearance extension request SLS stated the account would be evaluated ( Exhibit A ). In the subsequent approval SLS never stated ( or discovered ) that the loan had exceeded the modification limit. I also note that for our appeal it took only three business days for SLSs independent review ( dated // ) to make this determination ( Exhibit  ) - implying this did not take much effort and could have been easily determined when we first applied for forbearance. 

Since being denied any retention options other than lump sum, on multiple calls to SLS I offered to accept a payment plan or any reasonable means to stay in our house. Currently, our financial outlook is positive and I restarted payments in // and will continue. It is only the  forbearance payments that are outstanding. 

Lastly, on //  sent a notification ( Exhibit F ) stating they will begin accelerated foreclosure in on // if we do not bring our account current. An SLS agent told me we are on the fast track for foreclosure. We are asking for some resolution before foreclosure begins and we are also liable for any legal costs. I have explored refinancing but we were unqualified because of the forbearance. I also looked into government mortgage assistance programs, but we are not qualified. 

Conclusion : We contend : 1. It was in the least negligent and possibly deceptive for SLS and the investor to have offered forbearance when they could have easily told me in advance that we were ineligible for loan modification. 
2. As such I did not get accurate and timely information to make an informed decision on forbearance. It is not my fault that we did not receive pertinent information that I had no realistic retention options. SLS stated they could not tell me this until I applied for a loan modification however it makes no sense to apply for a loan modification until I went through forbearance and only then knew our financial situation. Knowing that a lump sum was the only retention option, I never would have entered into forbearance and consequently put our home at risk. I was continually reassured during the extensions that SLS would work with us, but they arent. 
3. In the initial forbearance was I told the lump sum amount, all subsequent letters mention that SLS wont know the assistance that can be offered until I apply, but no lump sum is mentioned. In this correspondence they state : we realize that most people will not have the funds to immediately pay the months of paused payments 4. We do not know regulatorily what is required from the investor but the CFPB website page ( https : //www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-forbearance-during-covid-19-what-know-what-do/ ) states : Forbearance ends with a payment plan, not a lump-sum payment Homeowners who receive COVID hardship forbearance are not required to repay their paused payments in a lump sum once the forbearance period ends. 
How can a lump sum payment be expected at the end of the forbearance when we did not have the means to keep up with payments to begin with? 
5. I was current on our mortgage at the beginning of forbearance and would have continued to be except for this natural disaster. COVID-19 is unprecedented and should be handled as such despite investor guidelines. We have financially recovered, resumed making payments, and will continue. 
. As a secondary complaint, during the last several months I never talked to the same person at SLS twice. I was assigned a single point of contact but that person was never available when I asked. Depending on who I talked to I was given different options on what possible actions to take. Most notably on // I talked for a long time with a very concerned and sympathetic agent who said she would propose a repayment plan to her team and let me know in a week. A week later after not hearing anything I called and talked to someone else who said it was denied almost immediately according to their records. Im not sure if I would have heard a decision if I hadnt called, but it wasted a week of our time on a tight timeline with foreclosure looming. Its also frustrating since I seemed to talk to two different departments, one has to do with mitigation and the other possibly foreclosure prevention. They dont seem to talk to each other. Each time I have to explain the circumstances and start from the beginning. 

I built the house in , raised a family here, and invested much time and money in upkeep and improvements. This is where my wife and I plan to retire. I repeat from our review letter to SLS and the investor : Despite the loan modification limit, we are also making an appeal for understanding and help. We are desperate to keep our home and all we have invested and honestly do not know where we will go if we are forced to move.

Just before  last year we discovered that our dishwasher was leaking for quite some time. It was to the extent that our kitchen and adjacent bathroom floor were damaged, and mold had started to grow. The workman who discovered the leak advised us to contact our insurance company. The insurance company sent in teams to block off the kitchen area, remove the counters, flooring, and to conduct mold abatement. When this was completed and the tests came back negative, the insurance company recommended a contractor,   , to reconstruct the kitchen and bathroom. We signed a proposal with them and they were scheduled to start after the  holidays. 

On the day the contractor started work, I paid {$2500.00} towards the half of the {$31000.00} we agreed to pay them at the start. The remainder will be paid when the work is completed.

We sent the check to be endorsed and returned so that we can pay the contractors for their work. Instead, M & T Bank cashed the check and is now holding on to the funds.

708,2022-04-06,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"Around //, me and my wife started looking to purchase a new home. At the time we owned our current home and still had a mortgage which we were paying each month. Due to the rental rates in our area, in // we made the decision to rent our home, instead of selling it. 
I researched lenders online to determine if there were any lenders that had less than 20 % down payment programs. I work in the mortgage industry ; therefore, I contacted a few lenders I know to see if they had less than 20 % down payment programs. Several of the lenders indeed had programs which offered less than 20 % down payment. Since most of the programs required at least 11 % - 15 % down payment, I decided to keep researching lenders for a program that allowed less than 10 % down payment. A lender named Paramount Residential Mortgage Group ( PRMG ) which states on their website ( link below ) We specialize in mortgages above the conforming loan limit with as little as 5 % down up to a sales price of {>= $1,000,000}. 10 % down up to a sales price of {>= $1,000,000}. Here the link to the website https : //losangelesjumbomortgageguru.com/manuel/?  #  I contacted PRMG to inquire about the 5 % down payment program. After speaking to the loan officer and understanding that I would have  as a second mortgage, I felt comfortable with the program and decided to obtain a pre-approval letter. I provided all the necessary information/documentation for the pre-qualification and on //, received a pre-approval for {>= $1,000,000}, with a down payment of {$62000.00}. Attached to this complaint is the pre-approval letter. 
Since we were looking for a new build there was one builder that refused the pre-approval letter, due to the mortgage company may not meet their deadlines for a conditional approval. 
On //, we entered into a purchase agreement with the builder , to purchase a home in the amount of {>= $1,000,000}.  also required conditional approval deadlines, which was //, and close of escrow deadlines which was //. PRMG was able to meet the first deadline and provided a conditional approval on //. However, on, //, I received an email from the processor on my loan at PRGM stating we are still short to close {$15000.00} not including the closing costs. At that moment, my wife and I were confused, how did we receive a conditional approval in , but now we are short to close {$15000.00} not including closing cost, nothing changed with our income, assets, or liabilities from  to . Instead of renting our property we made the decision to sell and use the proceeds to pay the {$15000.00} and closing costs. We informed PRMG that we were going to sell instead of rent the property. 
On //, our sell was completed, and I inquired with PRMG if we would be signing docs but was informed the  loan docs were still pending. //, at , I received an email from my loan officer at PRMG stating ; I am so sorry for the delay. Our second lien holder is giving us prolems since you sold your house. The change, changed our approval ( I would think for the better ) they are saying they are worried about payment shock and are worried that if one borrower leaves the others will have a hard time paying. They are NOW only wanting to approve us to 90 percent. We have the approval and can get docs but we have this change. 
I am so sorry. I think I am going to find a new second investor. Please call me if you want to discuss. The rate is better but it's an additional five percent down. Once again I'm sorry for the last minute change. We have been waiting for docs and I just got a call from management today. 
Once again we were confused since we sold our home we had over {$300000.00} in equity that we received, the day before we are set to close the  company will not approve an additional 5 % because they are worried about payment shock and on person might leave. Why would there be payment shock on a  loan that is // loan nothing changed with our income, assets, or liabilities. Also, there are four people on the loan. Myself, my wife, my wife mother, and my wife father. My wife and me have been married for 12 years and together for 25 years. We just had a baby //. My in laws have been married for 42 years. So, for PRGM to say they are worried if someone left the loan is not a condition for us to come up with an additional 5 % down, when we were conditionally approved by PRGM twice. Also, the loan officer offering to find another lender was not acceptable, when she knew that we needed to close escrow the next day. 
We did not want to pay the additional 5 %, but since we had sold our home and was waiting to close on the new home we were now , we had no choice, but to pay the additional 5 %. We paid the 5 %, closing costs and signed docs all on //. We were thinking the nightmare was over, but it was not. On Friday //, the end of the week, I was on the phone all day with the loan officer to confirm if we were going to close escrow and finally was advised that we would not be closing escrow. Once again PRGM was waiting on the  company to close escrow, but they did not receive a 1004D in time to close. Once again, I am in the business, a 1004D can always be provided post close as well, but a 1004D was keeping me  over the weekend. We finally closed escrow //, after , the builder sent an email stating they would not hold up the property any longer and would have to charge us 1 % for delay passed //.  and the   company was able to close escrow after receiving that email. 
This 5 % program that PRMG offers seems like a bait and switch program, since PRMG knew I sold my home and have additional assets prior to close. The conditional approval in // was based on use renting our home not selling it. We can not understand why the // approval was changed after PRMG was provided the final settlement statement from the sell of our home. I am sure this is a TRID and/or UDAAP bait and switch violation, since PRGM change the offer 2 days prior to close when they provided a conditional approval //.",,PARAMOUNT RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE GROUP,CA,92618,,True,Web,2022-04-06,Closed with explanation,True,True,5411989,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['approval', 'close', 'payment']"

Guaranteed rate had then placed a Lender placed insurance at an high price on my behalf and sent me the bill. I had refuted this and they said they will review it and fix it.

Guaranteed rate said that it was paid for by Guaranteed rate but Chase has to straighten its record.

A week later, I was told that there were other requirements for the approval of my loan, that my current mortgage needed to be paid off, the closing date needed to be moved or the mortgage contingency on the contract of sale of my current house needed to be removed from the contract. I complained that they had already approved my mortgage and that these late requirements made it almost impossible. I sent a complaint to their complaint department and to their CEO and they reiterated their demands. Then they told me that they were not going to use my current mortgage in my debt to income ratio but that I needed to get a distribution plan from , the company where I have my IRA- this is not possible, there is no such thing- it is a self directed IRA. 

I made plans to purchase the new house with cash and choose another mortgage company in the future and so removed funds from the IRA as a short-term loan using the once-yearly rollover ability for IRAs. 

This morning, //2021, I was told that my mortgage was done and that I should wait for underwriting to send me the paperwork to review and approved so it can go to closing in time for the closing on //2021. Just hours later, I am sent the same demands for contingency removal and distribution plan. 

1- Better wants proof that I, as a retiree, can prove that I will have solid income for the future when they do not require this of people with jobs.

2- Better has told me on two occasions that my mortgage was approved only later to tell me they had the same requirements, requirements which I was told were no longer required.

3 - Better waited until no more time was available for me to get another mortgage before they started adding requirements to what was already an approved mortgage. 

4- Better required that I reinvest my IRA into an annuity so they could have proof of income. I am not sure that Better has the legal status to be providing securities advice and hold that advice as a requirement in their mortgages. 

I am prepared to buy my new home on //2021 with cash but will suffer when applying for a mortgage after the fact because of my rejection by Better and because it will be a cash-out refi on an already paid off home. If I can get a Better mortgage before //2021, I will, as that would be the simple solution even though I prefer not to do business with them any further.

Fay has stolen another {$2900.00} to start out the fiscal year of . 

I will break down how incompetent and derelict this entity is in performing its business. 
Because of improper use of my impound funds, Fay has caused penalties and interests to be accessed to my property taxes. This has gone on since they acquired the servicing of my loan.

I have requested that my impound account be canceled, that I will handle my own Ins. And Taxes. Fay refuses. So alas, I refuse to send my impound funds for them to play with. 

Point in case. 

I paid all of the taxes for  in full on //, see attached receipts. 
First-quarter payment of  taxes were due //. Fay sent a payment on //. This makes the payment past due 10 days with possible penalties and interest charged. This did not happen as I had paid them in full a month earlier. See attachments Second-quarter payment  taxes Fay sent a payment on //. Even after they were aware that all taxes had been paid in full for the year. See attachments I spoke to the County Treasurer and ask if they had received either of the so-called payments made to the  County Treasurer . Their reply was they could find no record of receiving them. And as the taxes had been paid in full. If they had received any payments, they would have been sent back to Fay. 

Now as of this date //2021, nothing has been refunded to my impound account. Of course, this is nothing new for Fay. They have not refunded the monies stolen in prior years. 

On //, I spoke directly to   who is supposed to be my account manager. I, ask him when they were going to refund my stolen monies. And of course, got no answer. Also questioned him about the ins payment that was coming due at the end of . Reminded him they had no need to pay it as I had already paid it in full on //. Confirmation Number . 
I ask him about all the problems. Breach of Contract, Improper use of my impound funds, stolen impound funds. Late or non-payment of taxes, refund of penalties and interest charged me for late or non-payments, refusal, and ignoring my Attorneys outreach.

Now here we are again. Fay has removed another {$2000.00} from my impound account.

I was promised a 30 day close and given CD paperwork to reflect that deadline. I was also assured that we would close at the end of //, then the excuses started rolling in ; first they blamed that my other house had not sold, that was taken care of, then I needed 3 letters of explanation from my employers, I had to change bank account information, I needed no less than 15 different letters of explanation and some were provided multiple times to multiple parties, and at least 70 pieces of supporting documentation.
I would return all documentation promptly and often wait 2 to 3 days to even hear back from DHI employees. When they would call, it was often at  on Fridays with the statement that additional documentation was needed immediately and this would further hamper my loan process if not immediately received. After returning the documentation, I would not hear back until the middle of the next week. Also, when contacted, more than once I was contacted by one individual and then when re-engaged that person was off for the next week and would be shuffled to another. No consistency on who was actually handling my loan at any given time.
In addition, I paid for a mortgage lock, but since DHI continued kicking the loan down the road, that was extended multiple times and I was charged for it. DHI should have at least eaten that cost.
Every step of the process it was stated it would only be a few more days, whereas by // ( 20 days later than originally promised ) and several mysterious layers of approval, my loan was finally turned back on ( apparently it was shut off ) and the process started again to finally close on the//. Many times I had asked and had another lender waiting ready to approve my loan, but was told it would be only a few more days. In truth I was being strung along to keep me at DHI. I should have followed my intuition and pulled out of the situation at the first sign of trouble and moved onto the original lender Integrity. I stayed because I believed DHI and their employees would be looking out for my families best interest. Clearly I was mistaken.
Although we received a large credit, it did n't make up for the additional {$4000.00} in expenses incurred due to DHI 's mortgage process. We incurred expenses for a month of lodging ( week at a time, due to being strung along ), additional storage truck rental, storage space rental, additional POD rental, purchasing day to day living supplies, added fuel charge, flight rescheduling, additional airline travel, and missed work for my spouse due to transportation challenges. This does n't even address the rescheduling needed for buses, a fence install, internet install, furniture delivery, to name a few. Pushing it back 3 different times also caused additional fees ( {$750.00} ) for a mortgage lock that I needed to pay although DHI was the reason for the delays.This almost drove us entirely from the home to start looking elsewhere. The irony of the situation is I was counseled by members of DHI on fiscal responsibility, but yet they were the very institution causing fiscal stress on my family. Is this standard practice!?!
Overall I ca n't remember a time I was treated worse by a service provider, let alone as a veteran. We were misled, strung along, lied to, belittled, and treated overall like our business did n't matter. This being said I would never put my name behind DHI and would tell anyone that asked that they should be avoided at all costs. The fiscal promises fall short and do not even go on to compensate for the emotional and  stress caused by your organization.

822,2021-09-29,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"RE : FORCING ME TO PAY FOR HAZARD INSURANCE ON A HOME THAT BURNED DOWN IN  I am in the process of rebuilding. 

My home burned down in the California  Fire on //. Since that time I have been involved in rebuilding my home. It takes 4 to 10 years to rebuild a home in   County. I have a building team who is busy getting each and every permit needed for the final permit to start actual stick building on site. 

My insurance company reimbursed me the funds held by my mortgage company. My mortgage company, LOANCARE, is holding the final amount of the mortgage, on which I make a payment each and every month while I am in the process of rebuilding. 

In  I cancelled the insurance on my home because my home burned to the ground totally and my property is now a hole in the ground where the home building once stood. Then my mortgage company has an insurance division that contacted me and insisted that I must pay hazard insurance in order to have a mortgage with them. I sent multitudinous letters explaining that the home burned down and I no longer need insurance for a home that is not existent. But I discovered that LOANCARE is divided into two companies one for sending you mortgage payment slips and another section that simply makes sure you are paying insurance. These two sections do not communicate and do not share information. It took me two weeks of constant phone calls to contact a supervisor who insisted I had to prove my home burned down. So I sent him two papers proving my home burned down and then they stopped attaching insurance that they purchased for my home to my mortgage payment. 

Now the insurance section of LOANCARE is once again sending me letters insisting that I take out hazard insurance on my home or they will take out insurance for me and add that on to my mortgage. I have called many times spending hours navigating their robot phone system to try to reach a supervisor. It seems I can only reach lower workers called resolution advisors who will tell me that they have my information somewhere in their files but unfortunately their system is robotized so that they will keep sending me letters to force me to pay insurance on a home that does not existor they will continue to take out insurance for me and add that to my mortgage payment. 

Either this is a scam or this company is so poorly managed that they just automatically do this to everyone. 
My home burned down in California. This company LOANCARE, located in South Carolina, took over my loan from my local bank a few years before the fire occurred. They have no knowledge or understanding of local conditions in my area. Most of their agents read from prepared scripted letters, listen to what I say and DO NOTHING. 

I have called the mortgage section of LOANCARE and they tell me they can do nothing about the insurance section since they are not connected to their data base. All they can do is give me the phone number of the insurance section. 

I had my home burn down totally. I proved it to them. I can not afford to pay insurance for a home that does not exist. I am now considering if there is a way to sue them for pain and suffering since I spend hours and days calling them to try to prevent them from taking out insurance on a burned down home which is now a hole in the ground. Their automated web site has no place to explain this. It is only set up to take in the number and name of your insurance policy. 

What can I do to stop this from happening? My building team suggests I contact government services or find a way to sue them to stop this process.

I was fit into ARM interest rate 7.00 %, recast and capped to 10 %, monthly mortgage payment jumped from {$2000.00} to {$3000.00}. Ive been recently unemployed have been unable to find work and began struggling with the mortgage payment. That was my full-time job now and my family I made a decent living. The problem is that between the time I became unemployed my household income was slashed in half and that is when I defaulted on the loan. Not long after the loan was transferred to Mr. Cooper I began trying to negotiate a home retention program. I could not make any progress same excuse that the necessary documentation to proceed was not received. It led me to believe that due to these findings that their company would provide me with a reasonable workout. However, instead of working with me, once again Mr. Cooper behaved unethically and set an acceleration to foreclosure. Luckily at the last minute someone in their legal department or somewhere else must have realized that trying to sell this property at foreclosure would be a disaster because Mr. Cooper could not show continuity of obligation nor prove their legal right to sell the home. 
The amount that I am required to pay on this loan to satisfy is doubled of what I paid. The home is worth fraction of what I paid. Although",,NATIONSTAR MORTGAGE LLC,NJ,07026,,True,Web,2018-10-02,Closed with explanation,True,True,3035531,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['cooper', 'home', 'mortgage']"

The flood hazard status of a property is determined by its location on maps produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ).

Occasionally FEMA revises the boundaries of the "" Special Flood Hazard Areas '' ( SFHA ) on its maps based on the construction or improvement of canals and levees that mitigate the possibility of losses from flooding in certain areas. 
LoanCare , LLC has recently contracted with an independent provider whose goal was to perform a flood zone determination on your property and to determine the location of your property on the current FEMA maps and identify its flood "" Zone '' status. There was no cost to you for this review. 
The results of the review indicate that your property is not located within a SFHA on the current FEMA maps. LoanCare , LLC does not require flood hazard insurance to be carried on properties that are not located in SFHA.

We understand that you may want to continue this coverage. However it is not a requirement and therefore, it is not our policy to have this as part of the monthly escrow payment. As a result we have deleted the monthly escrow for flood from the mortgage payment and performing an analysis of your loan. When this is completed you will receive a notice stating the change and if there is an overage you will receive a check. 
If you have any questions, please contact our Insurance Center at   between  -  Monday - Friday EST,  except for major holidays.

I noticed that happened when I checked both my mortgage account and banking info online. I attempted to pre-empt a late payment/fee by manually submitting another payment. My manual payment was processed correctly. However, Amerihome 's automated system attempted to take another payment and I didn't want my bank account to be overdrawn. So I had to issue a stop payment against Amerihome drawing from my bank account a second time. I also had to have Amerihome return the second payment because it had been processed and my bank account was affected. 

Now, for my // payment which was supposed to auto-draft on // I didn't realize I needed to contact the bank again to remove the "" stop payment ''. So, when Amerihome 's automated system tried to draw on my account it was denied. Again, I realized this before my payment would be late ( on // ) and I contacted the bank to remove the "" stop payment ''. Then I logged onto my account in the Amerihome web portal to try to submit a manual payment but the online system indicated that I could not use that function at that time. So I called Amerihome. The bank did remove the "" stop payment '' but the Amerihome rep who I spoke to on // did not help me at all. She said she couldn't see that the payment hadn't gone through. I should have just asked to submit another payment at that time but I couldn't foresee all the trouble I was going to have issuing a payment beyond that point. 

I intended to call back on // to give time for their system to catch up. However, I was ill that day ( I even got a   and have proof of doing so ). So, I wasn't able to call Amerihome again until //. 

On // I spoke to 3 different people who each told me that the reason I couldn't use the online system ( or the phone system ) to make a payment was because they were now requiring a certified check only. I argued that the payment hadn't been denied due to insufficient funds so requiring a certified payment didnt make any sense and could I please have that waived so I could make the payment over the phone and it not be late. I was told by the 3rd person I spoke to ( Ms.  rep # , in the Loss Mitigation dept. ) that she had the authority and ability to override the requirement for the certified check. She then proceeded to accept my payment with an additional fee of {$9.00}. She gave me a confirmation # of the payment transaction (  ). She said it could take up to 3 days to process the payment especially because the  was a national holiday (     ). 

So I have checked my banking and Amerihome accounts online everyday since and noticed once again that the payment has not been processed. Now, //, I am on the phone with Amerihome again and have been told that the payment was never processed because they could not override the need for a certified check and that the payment is now late and that I must send a certified check. Now I am at my wits end feeling as though I have been scammed this whole time. As I write out the details of this complaint I am on hold with Amerihome trying to speak to someone with some authority to assist me. 

My complaint that I wish to file against Amerihome encompasses the following : 1. Minor complaint : Their system was at fault for trying to draw a second payment after I had made an on-time payment manually. When I tried to alert Amerihome of what was happening they provided little assistance and no concern that their system might be flawed. 
2. Major Complaint : That my payment was still not processed after being told that Amerihome 's system 's requirement for a certified check was overridden and having been given a confirmation number for a payment made. 
a. Not honoring a payment made in good faith and, being asked to make that payment again with a late fee. This seems predatory and unethical. 
b. Throughout this entire situation I have been trying to pay on my mortgage in a timely fashion. However, Amerihome has blatantly lied to me at least once and consistently blocked me from making a payment. 

I believe I have made more than every effort to resolve this situation in a reasonable manor but that Amerihome is not cooperating. 

At this very moment : I am once again speaking with someone in customer service (  ) who says she can override the need for a certified check and take my payment.

903,2021-03-11,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"Follow-up to Transaction ID  from  Case #  Since my initial complaint in , I have recently asked Wells Fargo numerous times with no answer whether my wife,  ( divorcing ) has signed, notarized, and submitted the HUD partial claim 2nd lien loan on our house. After several attempts at communication,  has finally answered me about the issue on //, and said that she did sign and send in the loan documents to Wells Fargo several weeks ago. Yesterday,//, Wells Fargo Home Preservation Department told me they can not find my wife 's signed and notarized HUD partial claim contract documents in the Wells Fargo system. Either Wells Fargo has misplaced the documents, is intentionally withholding them from me, or my wife did not send in the documents. Married couples sign mortgage documents together ; ours are separate. I need to see we are signing the same documents and she actually signed them. I require a full copy of the signed and dated by my wife HUD partial claim documents, and Wells Fargo is not sending me a copy because they are saying they don't have it even though my wife says she mailed it to them weeks ago. 
My wife 's actions by not paying the mortgage on our house for 7 months in 2020 are a direct breach of the  Court 's//Agreed Temporary Orders forbidding encumbrance or additional loans on our house. She incurred debt of almost {$9000.00} over 7 months in 2020 all on her own without my knowledge or consent, no notice to the Court, and Wells Fargo did the same working with her, all without my knowledge or consent. On // I faxed the entire 21 page ATO agreement to the Wells Fargo Executive Offices including pointing out the relevant Court Orders and confirmed with Wells Fargo that they received the documents. 

This past fall, Wells Fargo told me in writing and on the phone several times that either borrower party had the right to put the loan into forbearance and modify the loan as allowed by the loan Note. There is no such language allowing unilateral action in the note by just one of the two borrowers. In a phone call and in her WF letter on ,  , Case Specialist with the Executive Offices, Wells Fargo finally agreed that the Note my wife and I signed at closing on the house in  does not state it "" allows anyone who signs it the authorization to make changes to the account, which include requesting payment assistance ''. This was a statement they had "" confirmed '' to me in their letter dated . Now the WF Executive Offices have agreed the confirmation was incorrect and the Note does not allow for such unilateral action. But still say both parties must sign the HUD partial claim loan in order to prevent foreclosure. 
Wells Fargo has been deceptive, and misrepresented the contractual obligations to me, their customer. I am being forced into this disobedience to the  Court 's Orders by  and Wells Fargo. This should be  's sole {$9000.00} debt based on her actions with Wells Fargo and breach of the Court 's ATO Agreement. This seems very wrong. However, in order to keep out of imminent foreclosure by my wife 's actions, for the current benefit of our children, and to try and preserve our house equity as much as possible, I will sign the HUD partial claim loan under protest.

At this point I could no longer continue the endless battle and we entertained putting the house up for sale. In  Citi Mortgage sent me a letter notifying us that our mortgage had been sold. All paperwork was provided to the lawyer and relator with the New mortgage holder 's information. When my relator called the company that our mortgage was sold to she was told, "" Not all files have been sent over and information is limited. '' My lawyer then contacted the same people only to be told that the mortgage was NOT sold that Citi Mortgage still holds the account. My Lawyer then contacted Citi Mortgage, at this time Citi Mortgage is requesting us to re-apply for a loan modification. There was NO explanation given as to why we received the letter, Nor why my relator was told one thing and the lawyer another. 
I have LOST complete faith in this company! NO ONE there knows what is going on and all that I get is a CONSTANT RUN AROUND and jumping through hoops. They are selective in the notes that are applied to the account. One month they will speak to the lawyer and relator and the next I need to submit a formal letter ( AGAIN! ) to Citi Mortgage to allow them to discuss my case. At this time we are attempting a short sale unfortunately Citi Mortgage will not provide a FINAL payoff figure to the relator making the sale of the house DIFFICULT.

Timeline : 1. I had a mortgage with Bank of America for the last few years. I had the auto payment setup which linked to my checking account of BOA as well. It went well for the last few years. And I try to pay my mortgage faster than the original schedule. 
. On //2022, I checked my mortgage and saw there is only {$1500.00} remaining on its balance. Thus I manually payed this amount via Bank of America from checking account to mortgage account. The amount was deducted from checking account successfully.

. On //2022, the above amount still didnt apply and I noticed that my credit score got negative impact significantly. Bank of America report a "" past due ''.

The problem is : (  ) if BOA need charge me those additional fees, why its system didn't charge via the auto payment which I always had enough balance. 
(  ) Those additional fees didn't show anyway in their mobile app, website, even in mortgage statements? which I wouldn't know at all if I didn't noticed my credit score impacted. 
(  ) I payed this mortgage way faster than the original schedule which caused a past due seems didnt make sense to me at all.

In discussions with our Mortgage Servicer (     ) about repayment of our missed loan payments while in forbearance, we had made an agreement on // that we would use the VAPCP Program ( VA Partial Claim Payment Program ). Wherein the VA purchases the forbearance period missed payments and places them in a second lien on the home, which is interest free and payable when the property is sold. 


On // the servicing of our loan, not the loan itself, was transferred to PNC Bank. We have come to find out they will not honor the agreement made with our previous servicer nor will they consider the VA Program as an option. ( verified in recorded phone conversations ). 


They are attempting, with the threat of foreclosure, to force us into filing a Hardship Assistance Application. This in itself would be fraudulent because we are not in a financial hardship situation. This Hardship Assistance Application is 16 pages long and is very similar to a new loan application. If we comply, it will give PNC Bank the right to dictate the manner in which the missed payments are paid back. This is entrapment. 


Through  telephone conversations ( most recorded ) we have determined that their end game is to do what they call a ""   ''. In reality, it will be a new loan because it will have a new total, a new interest rate, a new term length, and of course new fees. 


First, this enables them to add the missed payments into the entire length of the mortgage which will greatly increase the loan. As an example of which, early on, our former servicer attempted the same thing. They upped the interest rate and added  years to our loan, which equalled approximately {$110000.00}, to repay the missed payments which were {$32000.00}, an {$87000.00} fee to borrow {$32000.00}! 


Secondarily, they will now be able to sell the new larger loan and get a big payday because our home has doubled in value, making the loan more lucrative to an investor. 


In summary, If PNC Bank wanted to be simply paid back, they could use the VA   , which we chose, and have their money overnight.

This is particularly disappointing because since my loan was transferred to Bayview in //, I have had a terrible customer service experience. I started working on a Deed in Lieu around that time and it was stalled for over two years due to lack of responsiveness from   at Bayview and overall failure from Bayview to move my file forward, despite having had a complete file on three separate occasions. This repeated and seemingly deliberate failure to move forward my deed in lieu requested created a disparate impact on me and also resulted in a financial hardship on me. With the unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices ( UDAAPs ) policy in mind, I filed a complaint with the CFPB last year. After CFPB involvement, my deed in lieu was finally moved forward and eventually approved in //. At that time, I was advised that any and all debt, fees, and obligations had been dissolved and that I as no longer liable to Bayview. 

However, unfortunately, I continued to receive bills/statements from Bayview. I contacted   at Bayview on // to inform her of this and she advised that this bill/statement was an error and that Bayviews system simply needed time to update. I contacted her again on // to advise about that I was still receiving bills/statements and she said that the deed had been recorded and that I should not be receiving bills. 

Nevertheless, I continued to receive bills/statements. I spoke with   on // who assured me that the deed in lieu had been approved by Bayview, that everything had been processed on your end and that she showed a  balance for my loan in her system. I am frustrated and upset because I continue to receive bills/ statements and I thought that this matter had been resolved. 

I am reaching out to CFPB as it seems this issue has still not been resolved. So I am asking for you to help me to rectify this situation with Bayview.

He stated that no one from PHH had contacted him about the account. He also stated he did not have the check and that the account had gone to a debt collection agency for the township. This meant a tax lien had been placed on our property. The tax collector felt so badly for us, he took my phone number and told me he would contact me as soon as he got the check.

Until the last three years, we were always very happy with the service we received on the loan originations, refinances, and servicing.

He replied back // and left a message and replied to my email confirming no fees. Since he confirmed no fees, we did a verbal application over the phone, I gave him permission to move forward with the application and pull credit, and I sent all items needed. At that time of confirming fees, they had taken an application, received all financials, bank statements, , and paystub, knew the product, the term quoted, new the address, and all needed information. 
Then On Monday, he calls to review and take a deposit to look in. The rate now has increased to 4.25 % but with a  discount point ( {$1300.00} ). After getting off the phone I access the disclosures they emailed ( this is Monday night after  my family waiting to have dinner ) a noticed a {$470.00} processing fee, then fees I can not Shop for Appraisal {$510.00}, Credit report {$36.00},   {$7.00}, and   {$70.00} for total {$620.00}.

1035,2018-01-22,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"On //, I purchased a new home priced at {$460000.00}. I applied a down payment of over {$45000.00} towards the purchase and financed the remaining {$410000.00} through a loan with New American Funding. 
After little over a year, my property accumulated equity as my home was now valued at over {$560000.00} that would include upgrades to my property. On //, I contacted New American Funding to inquire about having Property Mortgage Insurance ( PMI ) removed. According to New American Funding, New American Funding would remove the PMI as long as the loan balance was paid down to 80 % and/or if the value of the property had equity of 20 % or greater. 
Therefore, I formally requested to have my PMI removed from my loan and based on the following factors ; 1. Since, //, home comparable similar to my property valued from approximately {$540000.00} to {$560000.00}, 2. as of //, loan balance was paid down from {$410000.00} to approximately {$400000.00}, and 3. as of //, additional upgrades in the amount of approximately {$10000.00} was added to my property value. 
I provided New American Funding with all the factors to be considered. Even though detailed, preeminent factors were provided for New American Funding, by conjecture New American Funding had ulterior motives other than to remove the PMI. 
1. In anticipation of cooperation from New American Funding, I formally and cordially requested New American Funding to start the process for review and consideration of removing PMI. Instead, New American Funding would delay my request for almost two months. 

2. As I inquired about the status of my request, I only received excuses from New American Funding representatives as they stated that they were either short staffed, the loan docs were misplaced and/or original request would have to be submitted once more. Despite the excuses given, it appeared that New American Funding representatives initiated my request once I suggested that I would elevate my concerns to management. 

3. As part of the process with the removal of PMI, the property value would be fundamental to excogitate any assessment in general but not paramount to any final decision. Hence, in an effort to mitigate any informalities and/or to avoid nonpareil circumstances, I requested to have an outside, third party perform the appraisal. Instead, New American Funding exclaimed that they would hire their own appraiser and that I would be responsible for the appraisal fees. Albeit, not only did such demand pose a parochial and biased argument on behalf of opposing party but indubitably creates an unjust outcome overall! 

Not only would unethical practices dampen the integrity of business relations but also created controversy among the New American Funding process. As a former State of California  and a former advocate for Consumer Affairs, I am reverently aware of business practices that seldom follow a standardization of integrity. Furthermore, any business that operate outside ethical standards of conduct may and/or may not create an internecine situation among business practice in California, but even more, impact business practices nationwide! 
Fortunately, with the help of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and after CFPB became involved, New American Funding apologized for any mishaps CFPB was able to amicably resolve matters without any further quandary. CFPB was very effective resolving matters in every aspect. In fact, CFPB went above expectations to assure business integrity among consumers and public affairs respectively. Hence, my  and I are seeking your assistance in amicably resolving issues that have repeatedly continued forward. 
In //, I inquired about removing PMI from my mortgage account and with New American Funding once again. To substantiate my request, I gathered public data to support my claim. 
On and/or around // and through //, I conducted a general, analytical market research of property value comparisons within a 19 square miles radius of and/or from my property location. I gathered data from //, and through //. Among data analyzed, I was able to compare homes similarly situated in square footage ( from  square feet to  square feet ), number of bedrooms ( 3 to 4 bedrooms ) bathrooms ( 2 to 4 bathrooms ) attached garage space ( 2 to 3 car garage space ) and overall living space. Other factors that were considered was the level of upgrades ( throughout the property ) if at all, and overall residential influences ( such as schools, business establishments, parks, etcetera ). To put it laconically, the overall property value has risen more than 19 % to 22 % overall. 
Therefore, it would appear that such empirical data would substantiate an increase in equity value of our home/s within the vicinity of data analyzed. 
With that said, I contacted New American Funding on //, to start the process of removing the PMI form my mortgage account. On //, I received a letter from New American Funding for instructions to Request For Cancellation of PMI and criteria that would be considered for the removal of PMI. New American Funding stated that I would need to write a formal request for removal of PMI as long as my loan met the standard criteria. 
Therefore, I responded to New American Funding and provided a list of qualifying factors that meet the criteria qualifications for the removal of PMI along with my formal request to have my PMI removed from my mortgage loan. 
Unfortunately, New American Funding entrenched a pattern of creating unnecessary delays and drawbacks after formally requesting a PMI removal. , I reached out to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) for assistance and in an effort to amicably resolve those dilemmas that appeared to be perpetual at the time. 
Albeit, time would be of the essence for a removal of PMI due to factors that may and/or may not influence interest charges based on time of the loan and the financial obligations that coincide with such influential obligations my aim was to respond laconically and provide pertinent information to New American Funding for the purpose of moving forward in an effort to mitigate and/or avoid any unnecessary time delays thereof. 
I also admonish that under Federal Law and/or The Homeowners Protection Act of 1998, such mandate may and/or may not serve as an operative guide in maintaining a level of integrity between the Mortgage Loan Industry and its consumers respectively. However, on //, I received a reply from New American Funding audaciously asking for information that I had already provided month/s prior and to reiterate information that is already on file. Furthermore, New American Funding are requesting {$140.00} ( BPO fee ) or {$450.00} ( appraisal fee ) made payable to New American Funding. Yet, in complete reverence to my request, it would appear that New American Funding would have intentions of obtaining their appraiser which may and/or may not create nonpareil circumstance/s. Such circumstances may and/or may not influence a one-sided party that potentially result in a bias decision overall! 
Contrariwise, to support my request to remove PMI from my mortgage account, I have met the following criteria under The Homeowners Protection Act ; 1. Since //, home value prices risen significantly in value from {$460000.00}, to approximately {$560000.00}. Therefore, Loan-to-value ratio is 78 % and property value would corollary be paid down by more than 80 %. 

2. Since //, home loan payment history continues to be in excellent standing. 
Regardless, New American Funding still have not removed PMI from my mortgage account. 
It is indubitably transparent that decisions made to stay and/or keep PMI charges on our mortgage account were based on their own nonpareil terms and/or conditions.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"BROKER SOLUTIONS, INC.",CA,91708,,True,Web,2018-01-22,Closed with explanation,True,True,2788919,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['american', 'new', 'value']"

On //2019, I emailed Ocwen that I could no longer afford to make mortgage payments on my cabin in , Michigan. The Ocwen relationship manager chatted with me by phone and recommended I enter into a deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure process. His description of how that property surrender would work sounded good to me, and I agreed to doing the DIL. The relationship manager told me to make no more payments and send no more bank statements. In //, I was contacted by an Ocwen rep who told me my cabin would be given an "" external evaluation '' ( a walkaround ) in a week or so, after which the DIL process could be completed. However, shortly after, I began receiving mortgage payment requests ( going back to // ) and was told that PHH was my new mortgage company, my mortgage had a new, PHH-assigned number, and a PHH relationship manager had been assigned to my account. I wrote to that man and explained that I had entered into a DIL process with Ocwen, and also asked him if he had any paperwork from Ocwen on that matter. He did not answer back. So, I wrote to PHH 's Escalation Group, which also did not trigger a response. I additionally wrote to the PHH Office of the Ombudsman, and got no response there, either. It certainly appears to me that Ocwen now has no intention of pursuing the DIL process with me, and I have formed a very negative opinion of both Ocwen and PHH.

I missed a payment and knew I needed help. The lender required me to be 3 months behind before they would entertain a modification. The process took longer than expected, but I never allowed the payment to be more than 90 days late ( 3 months ) and started making the trial modification payments on time immediately. 

The Lender has reported on my credit report 120 days ( not 90 ) as well as continued to reflect our payment as late during the trial modification. Once the modification was finalized we made those payments as agreed until such time as I sold the property. 

Because this was an FHA loan, part of the modification was a partial claim against the MIP. When I sold the home in  of , that amount was paid back as part of the home 's payoffs. 

I am now attempting to purchase a new home, and because of the inaccurate reporting on the credit report, it appears that I was more than 5 months behind on payments when in fact I was never more than 3 and now I have to wait another year when I have worked very hard to improve my credit, save money and reestablish myself in a more affordable location. Inaccurately reporting the lates is not only causing a delay, but it also makes me wonder, if the amount charged to FHA for the partial claim was incorrect and inflated and if the amount that I had to pay back was incorrect. 

It is unfair to force someone to get behind in order to help them, and it is also inaccurate to reflect a payment as late when under a trial payment.

I have tried unsuccessfully to get a hold of a mortgage service. Customer relations manager and home retention department state, I can only submit a complaint to notice of error. My mortgage was in a COVID Forbearance period. Following this, the loan modification presented to me by representative , agent ID (  ) did not follow the current VA law and guidelines. PHH raised my interest rate 0.5 % and forced me to pay back all the forbearance money owed immediately. 

This does not follow the current law which states : The VA partial claim program involves the mortgage servicer making a claim on the VA for a portion of the outstanding mortgage balancein this case the portion equal to the forborne payments. 
The borrower then owes the partial claim amount to the VA at 0 % interest and only due at the end of the mortgage loan. 
There are no monthly payments required from the borrower to the VA for repayment of the partial claim. After the VA pays the partial claim, borrowers restart their pre-hardship mortgage payments to the mortgage servicer with the same monthly payment as before the forbearance. 
The partial claim program is available for VA-guaranteed borrowers who are exiting COVID-19 forbearance plans and who were current or less than thirty days past due as of //. Borrowers must indicate to the mortgage servicer that they can resume their former monthly payment. The partial claim loan can not exceed 30 % of the loans unpaid principal balance. 
The VA issued a final rule setting out a partial claim program that, effective //, allows homeowners to resume their new regular monthly mortgage payments without first having to pay the past mortgage payments that were forborne under the COVID-19 program. See 86 Fed. Reg. 28,692 ( // ). 


In addition, the best option according to federal law is the VA Disaster extended modification. According to the VA servicer handbook ,      ( Disaster Extend Modification ) and in accordance with 38 C.F.R. 36.4315. This state, The rate must not exceed the borrowers current interest rate. The loan can be extended by the equal number of months the loan is delinquent due to the disaster. The limit of the term extension is 12-months without prior approval from VA. Servicer waives the delinquent interest. 

In addition to this an exception is granted for the following requirements in 38 C.F.R. 36.4315. ( a ). 38 C.F.R. 36.4315 ( a ) ( 4 ) : At least 12 monthly payments have been paid since the closing date of the loan. 

Taking all of these factors into consideration. I tried to reject the current offer and need a mortgage servicer to contact me directly. It appears, based on fact, following the current law with my mortgage loan, my loan shall go in accordance with federal law and the VA Disaster Extended Modification. The loan shall be extended 12 months, interest shall be forgiven, interest rate must not exceed current borrowers interest rate ( 2.75 % ). 

In conclusion, I was told, no mortgage servicer will call me or provide any contact information.  ( PHH ) is not following the current law ; they should be held accountable for their actions. 

I request my loan be modified in accordance with the current law. I also request a full audit for PHH. If the company is doing this to me, there must be doing this to countless other  veterans.

1131,2021-08-09,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"On //2021, I received a cancellation notice from my homeowner 's insurance company for non-payment of premium. I understood that my mortgage company, Wells Fargo, would be paying my annual homeowner 's insurance fee. My understanding of this was based on a written assurance from the agent who handled my refinance. Wells Fargo was my mortgage company both before and after the refinance. When I refinanced my mortgage in  of 2021, I noticed that the closing documents set aside {$840.00} in escrow payments for the payment of property taxes but had {$0.00} set aside for paying homeowner 's insurance. As a result, I wrote to the agent who originated my refinanced loan,  , to clarify and asked if the amount going to escrow every month would also be used to pay my homeowner 's insurance, as it had been during my previous mortgage with Wells Fargo. He replied that yes, my escrow would be used to pay both property taxes and homeowner 's insurance. On the strength of that assurance, made in writing, I understood that Wells Fargo would continue paying for my property taxes as well my homeowner 's insurance from the escrow account created through my $   monthly payments. 

When I called Wells Fargo to sort out the matter today, I was told that the closing documents indicated that money was only for paying property taxes and that there was no arrangement to pay for my homeowner 's insurance. The mortgage company, rather than acting in good faith to carry out the arrangement that I was assured in writing existed now and in the future, simply said that they could add paying homeowner 's insurance in the future if I paid extra money towards the escrow account. 

I was misled the company, and I believe it is their duty to carry out what I understood to be the terms of the agreement : I would pay {$840.00} a month towards escrow, and that amount would be used to pay for both my property taxes and my homeowner 's insurance. That would be the honorable course of action for them to take. Their false assurances have led to a lapse in my homeowner 's insurance coverage.

This is a yearly struggle in which they send us numerous letters stating that the coverage is insufficient and stating that they will charge us roughly {$2000.00} for additional coverage. In the most current year we have been working with the property 's insurance company, , to supply them with the information since //. While the property ( which is a multi unit resort ) coverage has not changed substantially in the ten years we have owned our condo unit, BofA annually sends us these letters threatening to charge us for unneeded coverage. This past year they have made the process even more difficult. Below is a copy of  the letter I sent them today. 

We have just received the sixth request, dated //, from you for flood insurance coverage on our condo located at    ,  , , HI .

As recently as // both I and our  representative spoke with your department in an attempt to determine what was still needed, and to supply that information. On that date,  faxed you the entire flood policy for the building that our unit is located ( there are three policies in total that cover the entire resort ). I was told by one of your representatives that this was all that was needed, just the policy for the building that our unit was located in. He could not explain why we seem to have had more scrutiny regarding these policies than in years past, when a policy declaration sheet was sufficient to satisfy your department. Not that it hasnt taken months in past years to satisfy these requests, but this year has taken six months to get to this point, and you still arent satisfied. It certainly appears that upselling additional insurance is the goal here. The basis coverages provided by the resorts insurance company have not significantly changed in the ten years that we have been dealing with these annual requests. 

The latest request indicates that the flood insurance coverage is insufficient, and calls for additional coverage at a cost of us of {$380.00}. This is exactly the same request that we received in a notice dated //, and was responded to by  with declarations in early //. How is it that now we are receiving yet another request?

We initially tried a traditional sale, but the foundation condition, I would not be able to break even. I started the short sale process with a realtor. Submitted all the paperwork, got the house listed, the realtor worked with the bank on the sale. Once a buyer came and made an offer, I moved out of the house and into an apartment. After months and months of the bank stating that we were missing documents and myself and the realtor resubmitting them, the bank came and said to us on Tuesday,   that due to more missing documents, they were moving forward with a foreclosure. I quickly resubmitted everything AGAIN and my realtor asked for an extension so that the bank could review everything. On Friday,  , my realtor called me telling me that he had just heard from the bank and they were moving forward with foreclosure and their new reasoning was because I had moved before the house was sold. ( I moved after a buyer put in an offer and this was OK 'd by everyone, no one told me not to move ). On Monday,   the bank contacted me telling me that they declined the sale offer and were moving forward with foreclosure for a completely different reason. Their reason on this date was because of the condition and the damage to the house. I specifically asked what damage they were referring too. They said they found damage when they went out and inspected the house. I asked them what date specifically did they come and inspect the house because they never called me or my realtor asking for a key, or the lock box code to get into the house. The bank told me that they did n't need to ask for a key because they have already secured the property with their own lock box. So I asked again, what date did you do this and how did you get in without a key to secure the property and inspect it. After demanding that they tell me WHEN they went out there, I was put on hold for about 10 minutes and when she came back on the phone, she said that she had made a mistake and that they had n't gone out to inspect the property. At which point, I got very irate with a bank, a business blatantly lying to me. So I asked again, why they were foreclosing now, and she again said because of the damage. So I asked what damage since they had n't been out there. She then said that it was too close to the foreclosure date ( Tuesday,   ) to be able to do anything. At this point, I go, so on  , you said you were foreclosing because of missing paperwork, ( which was all resubmitted again ), and on Friday,  , you said you were foreclosing because I had moved and had broken some contract by moving, and now on   your reasoning is because of damage that you have never seen because you have never been out to inspect it. Every day it was a different story. I hung up on the bank, and called my realtor who then called the bank, and the story that he got on the foreclosure was because the buyers offer was too low than what they thought the house was worth ( I guess they got that off the internet or something, because again, they have never been inside the property ).

I was approved for the mortgage and received a disclosure containing a rate of 2.85 % for 360 months. The rate contained in this disclosure was contingent upon opening a non-accruing checking account with First Republic and maintaining a balance no less than 10 % of the loan amount or {$38000.00} for 2 years, with the loan amount being {$380000.00}. A subsequent disclosure was dispatched detailing an interest rate of 3.1 %, a modest increase, but one that carried significant repercussions over the lifetime of the loan.

It was later revealed to me further along in the process that in addition to maintaining a balance of {$38000.00} for two years, that I'd need to switch my direct deposit to use this account, as well as opt into automatic payments from this account for the monthly principle and interest.

The experience with this VA Loan has been an unmitigated nightmare. 

For several months we have been trying to communicate with the insurance section of Loan Depot to get them to remove the forced placed insurance of {$250000.00} on this property referenced above. 
The tax value of the structure is {$38000.00}, the replacement value is just over {$100000.00}. We have {$140000.00} of coverage. Loan Depot claimed they need the maximum that FEMA allows .... {$250000.00}. 
The value is in the land because it has an easement to the  . Our insurance broker has sent proof of value to Loan Depot..

Please check the notes on file with Loan Depot 's Customer Service Reps. For months we heard absolutely nothing from Loan Depot 's insurance office- MONTHS!! 
I did receive a call back in  from a gentleman in the  , CA office of Loan Depot who told me that the VA Loan on this property was not in compliance with VA regulations because we had refinanced the property within 200 days of the last refinancing. This was not true as the last refinancing was in  or . I told him that and he said he would research my statement and call me back. He has not called back as of this date. 

On //, , my wife, told me we had a letter from Loan Depot saying they had finally removed the forced placed flood insurance because they had received the documents our insurance broker had sent them. 

The same day that letter arrived another letter from Loan Depot was received saying that the flood insurance on this property was insufficient.????? 

As I do occasionally during the month I check our bank accounts. I have an automatic draw that allows Loan Depot to debit our account for the mortgage. I noticed that although the payments for two of our properties had been debited, the payment for   (  #  ) had not been taken out. 
I called and found out that Loan Depot had canceled the payments because we had only been sending what they considered partial payments for the past several months. I called and the phone person said she would escalate to a supervisor. I made a one time payment of the normal amount. I was told that now because they had removed the forced placed insurance a new escrow analysis would have to done. Until that was done they couldn't change the amount of the payment back to the original amount. 
do during the period of the last 4 months Loan Depot is now saying that the original monthly payment of {$1400.00} is incorrect and a new amount of {$1600.00} is now the proper payment. Obviously, I complained because the amount {$1600.00} reflected the forced placed insurance cost even AFTER that insurance had been removed by Loan Depot. Now, instead of reducing the payment amount, Loan Depot is saying that our monthly payment will be over {$1800.00}. We would never have refinanced the property if the monthly payment was going up over {$400.00} per month within the first few months of the closing. The principle and interest is approximately {$1000.00} per month which means Loan Depot says the taxes and insurance products are costing almost {$10000.00} per year for a house that has a tax value of {$38000.00} Please do not be confused or bamboozled by your contact at Loan Depot. CFPB can and should have all the documents and recordings of calls to determine what Loan Depot is trying to accomplish. 

I would suggest that you have Loan Depot send CFPB a complete record of both phone operators ' notes and written correspondence so you can understand the frustration we have been experiencing with the lack of responsiveness from Loan Depot. There is no way a consumer/veteran can get through to the   headquarters to complain and seek resolution. This company needs to be fined, rebuked and admonished to service their customers in a efficient and proper manner. 

Of the three properties we refinanced with Loan Depot it has been only this VA Loan that has ( so far ) been a problem. All three of these loans have the Loan Principal, Interest, Taxes and insurance INCLUDED in the payments so it is Loan Depot 's responsibility to make these payments on-time. We continually receive notification from Loan Depot that our insurance is about to expire and would we send proof of renewal. We even got notice from the   carrier that our insurance premium had not been paid and was therefore terminated. Fortunately we caught Loan Depot 's mistake and paid the premium. Loan Depot charged us a late fee for the insurance payment being late. Loan Depot is responsible for paying the insurance out of escrow and our monthly payments. We should NOT be charged a late fee. 

I feel that some form documenting this loan exists in the bowels of Loan Depot HQ. These must be a mistake or unpublished documentation in those original documents. 
Please attempt to get all documents and operators ' notes from my phone calls I have never had such a problem with a company before in my life.

He, on the other hand was not instructed to sign anything, but was told he shall assume, indemnify, pay and hold me harmless for the property. That was . 
Since  my ex-husband has paid the mortgage late and once went as far as foreclosure proceedings in . 
To my surprise and horror I sit here today with my name on that mortgage and it appears I pay that mortgage late every month on a house I have n't lived in since . 
In  my neighbor bought the house I 've rented since  for me, and I pay him 8 % interest for an unconventional loan because no one will finance me due to the other property for one reason or another. 
They all say they can acknowledge what the situation is and how it has affected me and my credit, but can not make exceptions for it. 
I have a three year agreement that has reached its end with my neighbor that I would refinance the home by now or he would take it back, as he needs to access the equity, and I can remain in the home as a renter for two more years while I continue to improve my credit. 
There is nothing more I can do to improve what used to be a score in the mid to high  dropped to a horrifying low of  at one point during the four years it took to get divorced. It was  before I started shopping around for refinancing over a month ago and I am still looking for someone willing to lend me money. 
I have done nothing to warrant the way I look on paper and can not legally be held responsible in any monetary way because the mortgage on a house that is not mine is paid late. 
What makes me think anything will be different in two more years? It 's already been five years and instead of refinancing in two years, I 'll be looking for a home purchase loan that requires 20 % down and if I ca n't find a loan the house will go on the market. 
I already had to move out of that house once for six weeks in order for   to sell it back to me after being my landlord for two years. I have over {$100000.00} invested between rent and mortgage interest and I 'm not a spring chicken anymore to be buying a house to save up the equity when I already have equity here. 
It makes me sick when I think that in two years I will be  and the mortgage I took out in  should have been paid off. The extra money was to go to retirement, retirement was to grow and I would n't be a poor old woman depending on my kids ( I only had  instead of  ) or the government in my old age. 
I already suffered the Universal Default on credit cards because he paid late. 0 % - 2.99 % soared to 24.99 % - 32.68 % and I never paid one day late on anything and to top it off they were not my charges, but mine anyway through marriage. 
What good is a court order if creditors do n't acknowledge them? 
How do you get your name off a house by refinancing when no one is willing to refinance for him. Besides why would anyone want to refinance a 2.875 % loan? 
How does one end up this way after having been through a court of law? What fair or just law takes away ownership rights and leaves the liability?

1263,2019-11-04,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I recently signed up for Chase bi-weekly mortgage payments as Chase advertised that I would "" Save money '' and "" make an extra mortgage payment '' each year. Both statement are inherently true : if you make an extra mortgage payment you will save on interest. 

What Chase does not tell the customer ( me ), is that they are not applying your bi-weekly payments to your mortgage Chase is withholding the first bi-weekly payment ( assuming in a non-interest bearing account ) and then paying your normal monthly loan payment once the second bi-weekly payment is received. The customer is "" saving '' because there are 26 bi-weekly payments ( 52 weeks ) in a year vs. paying twice a month or 24 payments for 12 months. 

I believe there is possibly a TILA issue and a UDAAP issue here. First, my mortgage payment is not being applied to my account upon receipt. If I pay my mortgage bi-weekly, the funds could/should be broken down to principal, interest, and escrow, thus, reducing the principal amount every 15 ( or so ) days. If my principal amount is reduced bi-weekly, then my interest amount would/should be reduced bi-weekly. Over time, the amount of interest I pay would be reduced by # 1 the extra payment each year AND # 2 the interest savings from the bi-weekly payments. Currently, the only benefit to bi-weekly payments is making an "" extra '' payment due to the number of weeks in a year. 

Secondly, I believe the bi-weekly payment marketing is misleading ( UDAAP ) as I was not aware that Chase would be withholding my bi-weekly payment until the second bi-weekly payment is made. There is potential that Chase is putting my funds into an interest-bearing Chase-owned bank account while they wait for my second bi-weekly payment, thus making more money in interest. By making bi-weekly payments, I forego the opportunity to earn interest on the money I give to Chase. Had I known that Chase would not apply my bi-weekly payment when it was received, I would not have signed up for bi-weekly payments as there is no principal and interest reduction value for the 15-16 days it sits in a Chase account. 

I called Chase on //2019 at    EST and spoke with   who listened to my complaint. I asked that my complaint be brought to the Office of the President. I also stated I would file a complaint with the CFPB.

The reason we submitted a second request was due to a change in circumstance, which was that my son who was previously not working due to his wife and newborn being admitted to the hospital, began working again and had income to contribute to our household. The second modification denial came on //. The program, Home Affordable Modification denial reason that states, "" You have not made at least four contractual payments on your loan. '' But on // we opened up a help ticket with AmeriHome tech support because we could not login to they web browser to make payments or sign up auto billing. They never responded to us and we opened a second ticket on // and still heard nothing back. We are not able to view the website to see paperwork mailed to us and with living rural and having mail theft it makes it very difficult to know what is going on. Throughout our hardships and after several attempts to pay our mortgage by the phone, we realized we were too far delinquent to make up the missed payments and our only chance at keeping our home we would need to request assistance from the bank. Our attempts to make up our mortgage payments were ignored therefore we could not comply with the guidelines that stated we needed to have made four contractual payments. The reason for my complaint today is that AmeriHome has demonstrated hypocrisy, stalling my request for assistance only to deny my modification requests. This mortgage company has not taken my mortgage modification request seriously and has not even presented the workout package to my investor. They have thrown up red tape and made up denial decisions without validating or explaining these supposed program limitations or investor guidelines.",,"AmeriHome Mortgage Company, LLC",CA,93536,,True,Web,2019-06-28,Closed with explanation,True,True,3289718,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['modification', 'mortgage', 'denial']"

I made this payment on time ( see attachment # 1. showing my bank statement with NewRez Shellpoint cashing the check on  , . My payment is not considered late until it is received after the  of the month. My ,  payment would have been sent in earlier in the month but I had to spend the early part of  in many phone conversations with Shellpoint and NewRez trying to resolve a real estate tax issue. I have not been late with payments to Shellpoint ( NewRez ) or Ditech. ( Ditech sold my account to NewRez ( Shellpoint ) ). See attachment # 2. showing my payment history provided by     

Concerning my ,  mortgage payment, Shellpoint ( NewRez ) knowingly and wrongfully included additional new charges for real estate taxes in which I am exempt. Shellpoint ( NewRez ) did this with full knowledge that I was exempt from real estate taxes as indicated by records maintained by Shellpoint ( NewRez ). This wrongful and willful action taken by Shellpoint ( NewRez ) caused my ,  mortgage payment to increase by about {$900.00}. 

I attempted to resolve this real estate tax issue on  ,  by notifying Shellpoint ( NewRez ) of their error via a phone conversation and faxed them a copy of my real estate tax exemption status for year . See attachment # 3. showing fax sent to Shellpoint ( NewRez ) dated  ,  including my Real Estate exemption certification. See also, attachment # 4. showing the  through ,  mortgage statements. Please take note of the nearly {$900.00}. increase from ,  to ,  due to Shellpoint ( NewRez ) 's erroneous charge for real estate taxes. 

According to several Shellpoint ( NewRez ) representatives I've talked to, Shellpoint ( NewRez ) records show that I have been exempt from real estate taxes but for reasons not provided to me, Shellpoint ( NewRez ) decided to start billing me for real estate taxes beginning , . My personal records show I have been exempt from real estate taxes since . See attachment # 5 showing a several year history of my real estate tax exemptions. My current real estate tax exemption continues until //. I have never before been charged for real estate taxes in past months by Shellpoint ( NewRez ) or Ditech which sold my mortgage to NewRez. 

For my ,  mortgage payment, I paid {$1000.00} which was the amount I was told to pay by a Shellpoint ( NewRez ) representative on  ,  during a phone conversation. Shellpoint ( NewRez ) records phone conversations so there should be a phone record of this conversation. Even though I provided proof to Shellpoint ( NewRez ) on  ,  that I was exempt from real estate taxes, Shellpoint continued to identify my payment as a partial payment because the payment did not include real estate taxes. Shellpoint ( NewRez ) then notified the Credit Bureau that I had made a late payment for ,  because it did not include real estate taxes. 

I made my ,  mortgage payment to NewRez Shellpoint which I am contractually obligated to do. This payment was made on time. Since then, Shellpoint has corrected my mortgage payment so it does not include a charge for real estate taxes and refunded a late payment charge. See attachment # 6. showing my new normal payment and refund of the late charge. However, for the last 90 days, Shellpoint ( NewRez ) has failed to take action to delete the 30 days late payment notice for ,  which they sent to the credit bureaus. 

Shellpoint must delete this late payment notice on all credit bureaus which they have allowed to persist for over 60 days. See attachment #  showing the late payment notice appearing at   and the damage done to my FICO score.

For anyone unaware of what has happened and continue to happen. You need only to look at statements dated //2015 & //2015 where the principal balance remains exactly the same.

My mortgage broker has let me know that Quicken has really struggled with new loans registering at Quicken and their set up process. They are also offering interest rate lock timeframes that they are not able to close loan applications within. 

But thats not the main issue. The issue is that they make you use one of their appraisal management companies, in this case the appraisal was ordered on // and was not completed until //. On that date the Broker received a notification that the appraisal was completed and available for download. The broker downloaded the appraisal and it said "" AS IS '' so no repairs were required. 

Timing was a little tight but we had enough time to close before the interest rate lock expired on //. Then on //8, 9 days after the complete appraisal report was delivered to the broker ; Quicken posted a new loan condition that the appraisal was now "" Subject To '' and listed a minor repair. 9 days later. And no one even told the broker about it! He happened to look in the file and saw it had been posted. Quicken has since removed the original appraisal report so that it can not be accessed but the broker saved the original copy. 

By waiting 9 days to make a change to a completed appraisal ; Quicken effectively blew my interest rate lock out of the water. The mortgage broker was without power for 4 days including the day the lock expired. He asked Quicken to cover the re-lock fee ( about {$1100.00} ) in light of the situation. Quicken refused putting the blame back on the broker. They then cut off the broker from doing business with them ever again. The broker has continually asked that they make this right for me and they continually refuse and put the blame on the broker. Also, interest rates have gone up since my loan and interest rate were originally locked in so Quicken knows they hold the cards and by not honoring my original lock they are now making more money in fees. Another {$1100.00}. 

Based on what the broker has told me about this happening to multiple other clients and how Quicken handled my application it looks like they are intentionally causing their clients to need lock extensions and re lock fees. This is predatory lending. We have tried to get them to make this right and they have refused. They have scoffed at us for threatening to file a complaint with CFPB.

Now, on //, I had my first Mortgage Foreclosure court date. After judicial review of the case, it was one of the rulings of the court that I submit new loan modification request documents to my lender, starting anew, with the package being prepared by a HUD accredited third party. 

When I mentioned to the court that I had a loan modification currently in review with my lender, the response was that I should start anew. This was agreed to by the Attorney representing the plaintiff , along with other other court stipulations. 

Prior to this date, my lender has sent me an "" in-house '' loan modification and had called several times to "" find out what I wanted to do ''.

1401,2018-07-13,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"The complaint is against both attorney   , of   (  ) and para legal   , for negligence and mishandling representation and mediation between myself and my mortgage lender Mr. Cooper/Nationstar Mortgage ( NSM ). Both NSM and , are attempting to sabotage my case and forcing my case past the statute of limitations. Due to my loan status of litigation, NSM, refuses to discuss nor consider my attempts at bringing my account current.   has only been recently been assigned to mitigate my loan after the first set of attorneys were replaced. My situation started back in // when I was forced to file a lawsuit due to NSM, failing to make timely disbursements of my hazard insurance, which resulted in cancelation of a low premium for hazard insurance. This is a direct violation to paragraph 3500.17 ( i ) ( 2 ) of RESPA : ( k ) Timely payments. ( 1 ) If the terms of any federally related mortgage loan require the borrower to make payments to an escrow account, the servicer must pay the disbursements in a timely manner, that is, on or before the deadline to avoid a penalty, as long as the borrower 's payment is not more than 30 days overdue. ( 2 ) The servicer must advance funds to make disbursements in a timely manner as long as the borrower 's payment is not more than 30 days overdue. Upon advancing funds to pay a disbursement, the servicer may seek repayment from the borrower for the deficiency pursuant to paragraph ( f ) of this section. As a result my new policy was twice as much forcing my loan into delinquency because I could not afford the new escrow amounts from the replacement hazard policy. Once my lawsuit was filed it was assigned to the previous lead counsel      , and I had been engaged in settlement negotiations as well as and modification efforts since mid-//, when my civil case was first filed.In fact,   has negatively impacted my dealings with my lender representing agent of Nationstar/Mr. Cooper ( NSM ), since day one. NSM, made the mistake of having   manage not only the litigation matter, but also loss mitigation efforts as well. The loss mitigation process required for her to be a go between and to adhere to processing my loan modification with NSM, as well as attempt to coerce me into dismissal of my lawsuit for various reasons. I refused. Then  intentionally stalled the negotiations for 10 months due to her involvement.At one point Ms.    received 4 separate transmissions of my complete loan modification request and supporting documents and basically for lack of a better words she refused to forward them to NSM for review. In fact at one point, she attempted to extort me, by offering to review my loan for modification assistance in exchange for me dismissing my civil case with prejudice as well as she offered me a meager cash settlement of {$500.00}. I refused again to dismiss my case and was forced to file a CFPB complaint against her and NSM, which in turn forced them to review my loan for assistance. Mind you, I have an FHA loan, which requires specific guidelines to be followed when a review for modification assistance has been warranted.   attempted to circumvent these rules once I filed a consumer complaint with the Consumer Financial Bureau ( CFPB ) case # , and  was called out and forced to comply with the review under FHA rules. I feel that these actions were her way of attempting to bring this matter to a quick close. I had to go as far as threaten her with amending my lawsuit with these additional claims for abusive extortion tactics in order to somewhat get her to cooperate. Her resistance has only aggravated this matter rather than mediate. Its also a fact that NSM, attempted to sell my home while  was in possession of multiple full packages for loan medication review which is considered dual tracking. I was forced to file bankruptcy to stop the sale date attempts during the modification review process in the spring of //. Webb had been a virus in my attempts to protect the interests in the home and my rights as a homeowner for what NSM, has done. Again, NSM, has single handedly forced my loan into delinquency as a result of mishandling my escrow account shortly after taking over the loan then NSM took over my loan and has not been current since.Fast forwarding, my loan was finally approved for loan modification assistance on //, payments due in the amount of {$1400.00} due // thru //. // through //, Hurricane Harvey hit Texas, most of our State was declared National Disaster within the first few days. FHA, immediately suspended all payments for Texas homeowners for up to 6 months or more if needed, until the state of emergency could be thoroughly accessed. Virtually everyone in Texas was affected by the storm in one form or another. Rather than   adhering to FHAs decisions of mortgage forbearance of payments, as my loans investor. She decided to have me make payments starting in // rather than //. Then she contacted me again stating that the payment wouldnt be due until //. Payment was made and somehow derailed because there was an issue with my bank account and I received no notice whatsoever about a retuned payment. I feel That , was definitely leaving something out and hiding the fact that payments were not being demanded by FHA at all. However, by the time that I had been made aware the modification agreement had dismantled and I was contacted after the fact by . I advised her that I had the ability to make up the payment or make 2 at once. I informed her that I would have made up the payment or payments if only informed in ample enough time. However, do to the fact that my loan is flagged as litigation in the system for NSM. No agents can call me at all for anything, and all communications are relied upon by  and  . She then was supposed to address this issue and determine when and where I could resume my payments to complete the trial plan.I never heard back from her and the last time that we had any communications was //. Our last set of negotiations were dated //, in which attorney  had presented to me via email per rule 408, a settlement of an amount that was considerably lower than what I had originally suggested in earlier in //.The last communications that I received from   are as follows : // To date Ive received no notices via process service from   , which would indicate compliance with the Docket Control Order, milestones Expert Witness Designation which was due // nor has any firm representing NSM, completed nor initiated Status Conference due by //. The discovery period ended//, and none of these proceedings steps have been adhered to.

There has been long blocks of time that has passed between communications with , and I feel their involvement has negatively compromised my complaint.

It appears that the new law group assigned to my loan by NSM, is also failing to adhere any of the civil lawsuit milestones.

The first red flags on this new servicing by Select Portfolio were Escrow account issues. I was constantly told I have an Escrow "" shortage '' and I made payments as soon as I was advised. Despite making timely payments, Select Portfolio Servicing would randomly increase my monthly mortgage payments using the "" shortages '' as their excuse. As this kept happening I asked the agents where my payments were going and they told me "" the tax office ''. So I went to our local tax office and asked them if they were receiving my payments from Select Portfolio. They looked at me like I had three heads and told me what I already suspected. Escrow analyses are normally performed once annually and the mortgage holder is given the results of the Escrow analysis at this time and decides how he/she wants to handle the shortage or overage RED FLAG # 1 - SELECT PORTFOLIO SERVICING TRIED TO TELL ME I WAS REQUESTING THE ESCROW ANALYSES AND THIS IS WHY MY MORTGAGE AMOUNTS KEPT FLUCTUATING. I TOLD SELECT PORTFOLIO SERVICING I AM ON A FIXED RATE MORTGAGE AND IN THE SIX YEARS THEY SERVICED MY ACCOUNT, THEY WERE HANDLING MY TRANSACTIONS NON-COMPLIANTLY. 

Very often I made "" extra '' payments to Select Portfolio Servicing and was very specific about how I wanted the funds disbursed. I told them to apply anything over the amount due to Principal and repeated this instruction to the agent processing my payments each month. Select Portfolio Servicing had a problem applying payments to Principal and very often ignored my instruction. Instead, they would place my extra principal payments in unapplied funds or mortgage. Because Select Portfolio kept changing my monthly payment due I could never accurately calculate proper crediting to my Principal account. RED FLAG # 2 - Compliant processing of mortgage payments. 

Due to my previous experiences with , I kept escalating improper handling of my account to the Ombudsman 's office at Select Portfolio Servicing. I eventually escalated this matter to    in , NY, The    in , NY and Congresswoman   's office in , NY. I have been reporting my mortgage compliance issues to the OCC, the CFPB, , , Attorney General 's Office, FTC and FBI for almost twenty years now and all of the government agencies respond with "" this is a contractual matter between you and the bank ''. Select Portfolio Servicing Inc. is not a bank. They are a "" debt collector '' / '' loan processor ''.  told me after reviewing my payment histories to report "" white collar crime '' to the FBI and the Attorney General. Both agencies referred me back to the CFPB and to real estate lawyers. 

I requested two conference calls with  , Select Portfolio 's Director of Compliance, a representative from Congresswoman      and my attorney,  . Account audits were requested and in  of  Select Portfolio Servicing reversed over {$5000.00} to my credit. They issued a new  but would not explain in detail what they did or why. 

I continued to make additional principal payments with the hope of getting away from Select Portfolio Servicing with a refinance and they continued to misapply my payments. I was approved by two separate mortgage companies for a refinance and lost out on one closing because the payoff letter generated by Select Portfolio Servicing was incorrect. I felt as if they were holding me  and kept calling their Ombudsman 's office daily to get what I needed for the second refinance, As the date for the refinance neared I reached out to   several times with copies to all involved. He replied that he was out of the office and gave me the names of people I could contact in his absence. I did contact them but none replied. Only one sent an e-mail stating he was in a new position and referred me to a  . No response there either. 

I received a call recently from   stating he was so sorry for everything that was happening, as much as was humanly possible. I told him I am a very forgiving person but said he was the Director of Compliance. I said I held him to a higher standard. I told him my account has been so mishandled that a forensic accounting is needed. I told him to do the right thing and conduct s forensic accounting. He replied "" I don't know if I can do that ''. His Ombudsman 's office finally agreed last week to do a forensic accounting but I doubt they will be able to finalize this by my closing date. There is just silence from Select Portfolio Servicing. 

I have been on the phone daily with the Ombudsman 's office and various agents at Select Portfolio Servicing begging for documents required by the new servicer. It was like pulling teeth. Nothing flowed smoothly. My most recent mortgage payments were also misapplied and not reflected properly in the requested payoff letters. The stress Select Portfolio Servicing caused me was unwarranted. Their responsibility to their mortgage holders is to compliantly handle their accounts and their duties. They fail in both arenas. 

 handled two of my previous mortgages. They charged bogus fees and also handled their mortgages non-compliantly. In my situation, I had to deal with the tragic death of my spouse and raising of  young children. I reached out to  for help and they claimed they never received my requests. They crisscrossed two separate mortgage accounts and forced me to go to  daily and to   them my proofs of payment on each account. They later claimed they lost my address and sent my mail to an obsolete address. They forced me into a bankruptcy where I lost one home. Despite the bankruptcy Judge 's order not to contact me, their company  did contact me and tried to negotiate a double mortgage payment monthly to save the home I lost.. They sent me personal mortgage statements for an  family in California. I received robotic, generated letters in duplicate and triplicate that made no sense. They never addressed the issues at hand. They had ruinners posting Foreclosure Notices on my properties. 

Now, Select Portfolio Servicing is doing the same thing - trying to cover their lies. I gave their Director of Compliance my spreadsheet which contains everything needed for analysis and resolution. Some things never change. 

After my bankruptcy,  broke into my current home saying they were "" securing '' it. They were supposed to secure the home I lost in a different county!!! They tried to auction my home and never informed me. It's a miracle I still have a roof over my head. The Judge told me I can keep and live in one primary residence but  thought otherwise. I have photographs. I have Police reports. I have receipts.  refused to reimburse me for anything. I had to make claims to my Personal Home Insurance for  's damages. And this is all okay? I don't think so! 

 took a year to issue a corrupt  mortgage and told me if I didn't sign it as provided that I would lose my home. I signed "" under protest ''. You don't just add thousands of dollars to a mortgage after you were non-compliant and smile about it   .  was right. This is white collar crime. 

My life was never the same after the bankruptcy. My credit was destroyed. You made my life  and then the icing on the cake - you sold my  mortgage to Select Portfolio Servicing.. Why pass the buck? I made no late payments. I complied with all the  requirements. I was ahead on my payments. 

After twenty years and after contacting every government agency assigned to mortgage fraud I know why. The banks, the regulators, the lawyers, the Judge 's are all in on the fraud. The word compliance is an oxymoron for "" acceptable '' white collar crime. There will never be justice.- "" forget about it '' I attach two spreadsheets with my mortgage payment histories with  and Select Portfolio Servicing. I also attach several e-mails I sent to   and my attorney last week. I still expect a forensic accounting from Select Portfolio Servicing. This is the only way to get a handle on their deception. 

Sad that a person has to waste another {$7000.00} just to break away from injustice with a refinance. I urge the CFPB with all that is within me to "" protect '' innocent consumers who have been incorrectly funnelled like a tornado into a bank 's bad batch of bad loans for no reason. After twenty years I am convinced all of this has happened to try to force a default on my loan. This is the only way   and the other banks involved with the bank fraud of the   can eliminate their fraudulent accounts and appear "" good '' once again in front of their regulators. What a travesty!

They still do not see my fax ( one I have faxed twice to the confirmed fax number ) and again I have asked for a supervisor/manager to contact me to help with the situation. I have not heard back from Freedom since then. I have now wasted two and a half months, getting nothing accomplished towards cancelling my PMI and have a mortgage company who does not communicate the requirements to me.

They paid this premium for a policy that is not on a property on which they hold a mortgage. This policy is almost double in cost of what our actual policy is on the property that they hold a mortgage. The premium that they paid ( {$4600.00} ) is for the policy which we have on our primary residence, and we do not hold a mortgage with them for this property currently. The property on which they hold the mortgage is our vacation home. In short, they used our escrow money to pay a premium for a property that is not tied to this escrow account. 

I received a check from   for {$4600.00}, as I had already paid the premium for our primary residence ( we do not have a mortgage on this home ). I had to call more than 15 times to get this error corrected beginning on the date that I realized that they paid the wrong premium. I was told that they did not have the declaration pages, which is not possible as we provided those at closing in  of . 

After making the payment to the wrong company, on , Guaranteed Rate 's escrow department recalculated my escrow based on this erroneous premium ; resulting in my mortgage payment being increased by 40 % from {$1800.00} to {$2500.00} ( see attached monthly statement ). I received this notice in //. 

I re-deposited the {$4600.00} back into my escrow account on , upon Guaranteed Rate 's direction. I called on  to request that they recalculate my escrow, and they informed that they would do this immediately. As of , when I spoke to a supervisor, they still not had done the recalculation. 

The actual homeowner 's insurance premiums that will be due in // are {$2600.00} in total, substantially less than the {$4600.00} that they used in their escrow recalculation. The increase in my mortgage payment is based on paying them back for last year and then the projected payment of {$4600.00} for next year ( both of which are incorrect ). 

I have spoken with multiple people, including supervisors, and they have told me that they can not adjust the new payment amount for a few months as that is their policy. Being that this is their error, I expected them to correct it immediately.

It turns out and email we were given for the SPOC was incorrect, but we always emailed  regardless! On the days I did call, I had to call over and over again!!!!! Reps were repeatedly asking for the SAME info OVER and OVER. I had to call back continuously until I got someone who was willing to look at the file. Thee file was in a perpetual review. For example, they were asking for an alimony awards letter that was clearly there with the income showing IN THE BANK STAEMENTS. I could NOT get the single point of contact on the line. ( see email threads ) Finally, after calling over and over I got  , to call me back towards the end of . She confirmed that she had the info. That was NEVER requested in the first place. So bad information was being relayed. Time was being wasted. Same day, she then asked for MORE bank statements that were already there. ( perpetual review ). She then asked for them OVER AND OVER again. I have an email trail that NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED proving this. 
This file has been severely neglected!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
The single point of contact then began asking for a LISTING AGREEMENT. Again, please review the email trail. I emailed her that the home is not for sale! I called in numerus times and got reps who are clearly there only to collect a paycheck!!!!!! I asked for supervisor numerous times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
On //2020 I spoke to  in the Texas office who review the file. ( took 3 calls to get someone on the line who was willing to assist ) and he confirmed that once again,   had made an error. The listing agreement is NOT needed for the file. That he would push the file to underwriting. This should have been done long ago as he sees ALL DOCS HAVE BEEN THERE!!!! 
While on the line with him,   calls me. She read my emails and confirmed she made a mistake. SHE ALSO STATED THAT IN WRITING VIA EMAIL. SEE THREAD. She stated she was looking at someone elses file at the time she was emailing me. She requested something not needed by mistake.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She then had the audacity to request bank statements AGAIN!!!!! I told her that she is NOT qualified to do this job! All info is there, and to top it off, that I have shellpoint on the line and they confirmed all docs are in and they sent the file to underwriting themselves. She then hung up on me! She also emailed me regarding the errors and the fact that she hung up on me ( please see the emails!!!! ) Today //2020, we called in and spoke to   and she stated the sale date is still set, and that   noted the file that it most likely will not be reviewed by underwriting due to the sale date! The reason for all these issues in the first place is her fault!!!! She did not do her due -diligence on the file. Never called me back, did not notate the file properly when documents were received therefore causing reps to give out bad information, she mixed up files, etc. 
Although there are numerous reasons why Shellpointss behavior is unacceptable, the issues that the homeowner would like to bring to your attention are the following : The SPOC is clearly not properly trained or is overloaded. 
Shellpoint has repeatedly requested that  update financials and other documents on a continuing basis.  has diligently complied with every request to the extent that a full narrative would not be productive. Despite her cooperation, Shellpoint still claims that there are missing documents. This is unacceptable. 
The number of times that I spoke with Shellpoint to check status of the file should extinguish any opportunity to excuse their behavior. Between the misplacement of her financial documents and the poor communication from Shellpoint, it is clear that they simply does not want to review her file for a possible work-out solution. By endlessly re-requesting and re-reviewing documents over and over, Shellpoint is manufacturing a prolonged negotiation with no real approval in sight. 
We are demanding this sale date be postponed. The file was neglected, not properly reviewed, files were mixed up, and it is extremely obvious that they are discriminating against   based on her Race, marital status, and national origin. The way this file was handled is unacceptable. There is NO reason any of this should have happened.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",CA,93637,,True,Web,2020-01-10,Closed with explanation,True,True,3492147,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['file', 'review', 'confirmed']"

1480,2018-11-16,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"Greetings, My wife and I are in the process of buying a new home in  , Texas and chose CHASE as our home loan provider. 

We had already made several contract offers on several homes over the past weeks and had been receding a GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE working with CHASE employee   /    adviser INMLSID , ,  However on our current contract offer, my wife and I provided the Sellers Agent with a written contract offer of {$550000.00} on a home that had been on the market for 88 days and listed at {$620000.00}. My wife and I included paying all normal Sellers cost 's like the loan title policy, survey, resale certificate and Sellers not paying the 3 % realtor fee to the buyers agent since a family member of ours was writing the contract. All of these efforts were to entice the Sellers to accept our offer of {$550000.00} knowing we were at our maximum purchasing limit. 

Upon submission and review of our written contract to the Sellers Agent, the only request back from the Sellers agent was for a pre qualification letter for the purchase price of {$550000.00}. 

My wife emailed   in writing requesting a pre qualification letter for {$550000.00} HIGHLIGHTED IN YELLOW. 

What we received back without knowing was a pre qualification letter for {$560000.00}. I unknowing sent the letter to the Sellers agent assuming I was working with a trusted professional. 

Once I realized what CHASE had done, I immediately panicked and realized CHASE had exposed us qualifying for a higher loan amount than offered to the sellers in the contract and took away our ability to negotiate for the best price. 

I immediately called   and explained to her what she had did was in direct conflict with what my wife had requested in writing. 

 , stated "" O, sorry I will get that corrected for you and send you another letter ''. 

I called the Sellers agent and stated CHASE had made an error and stated we were qualified for a {$550000.00} loan amount and to please not send the letter to the Sellers. The Selling agent stated "" Sorry, I have already sent it ''. 

I contacted   back and requested she provide the Sellers agent with the corrected pre qualification loan letter reflecting the {$550000.00} offer and to please explain this was an error on CHASES behave, which she did. 

Well as expected the Sellers countered our offer and agree to sale us the house for {$560000.00}. 

CHASE jeopardized our negotiating power and left us in a no win situation other than to accept the counter offer knowing there was no way to convince the Sellers that we really were not pre qualified for a {$560000.00} loan. 

My wife and I are now in the loan process with CHASE and expecting to close on //2018. 

My wife and I complained to the Supervisor of  ,  , NMLS ID , ,  about this huge costly error on CHASES part which cost us an additional {$10000.00} dollars. 

  informed us that CHASE would only offer us a {$3300.00} lender credit for the error. 

My wife and I then contacted     supervisor,   VP-Senior   Manager, NMLS ID , ,   was very "" matter of the fact '' about the issue and stated CHASE was only offering us a {$3300.00} lender credit and nothing else.  stated this was his decision and stands by it after speaking with Financing. 

 deflected from the real problem and stated in writing that CHASE did not obligate or commit us to pay $  for the home and insinuated we were to blame for accepting the Sellers counter offer of {$560000.00} and not negotiating better. 

 knows our backs are against the wall with requesting a very short closing date of//2018.I also expressed my concern of being retaliated against by CHASE and not processing our loan in time for complaining. 

My wife and I fill that we have been treated unfairly by CHASE and want to resolve this issue in a fair and amicable way. 

 's offer of only a {$3300.00} lender credit over a {$10000.00} dollar CHASE error leaves us expected to eat a {$6600.00} loss. 

Additionally the CHASE error added {$8000.00} more dollars to our mortgage.

We attempted to obtain a loan modification from SPS, but they refused to work with us, not willing to make any compromises on our previous predatory loan terms.

Earlier this year, a wind storm damaged our roof beyond repair. We took out a construction loan to replace our roof, and we also filled a claim with our   homeowners insurance. Of the {$6100.00}   allocated to replace our roof, our insurance coverage paid {$4300.00} with three separate checks. On //, my wife and I both endorsed these checks and sent them to  ( Hazard Insurance Claim Dept. for SPS ) along with all the other ( extensive ) documentation that SPS request concerning the roof replacement. 

In the meantime, we paid our roofing company the entire cost of the roof replacement from our roofing construction loan. Now SPS refuses to release the {$4300.00} in insurance remittances we sent to them nearly 3 weeks ago. Every time we call these guys to get our money, they come up with a new ( creative ) excuse why they can't release these funds.

We have another claim for interior damage for which we have yet to hire a new contractor, and we are worried how we will pay this new contractor when SPS deliberately delays the return of our insurance reimbursements. How are we supposed to pay our contractors with SPS sitting on our insurance money for such an extended period of time?

Communication issues related to forbearance, 3 ) .Delays from the servicer with regard to loan modification, and 4 ). Erroneous credit reporting during forbearance and modification period, etc. 
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, our VA home loan was under CARES Act forbearance from // through //. On or around //, Sun West Mortgage was contacted regarding our options for getting the mortgage on track once forbearance ended and possibly desiring to end it early ( // ) so that the mortgage payments could resume and we could refinance. Sun West indicated in multiple conversations that refinancing was not an option we would have with them. Several conversations took place during this two month period that went undocumented. 
On //, Sun West Mortgage intentionally reported the mortgage 30 days late for // while it was under CARES Act forbearance, presumably to prevent us from the option of refinancing with another company. We contacted them immediately on // when notified by another lender of the report. This matter had to be escalated several times to no avail until finally reaching an   ( Servicing Team Lead ) on // who sent an email instead of the requested explanation on company letterhead. The written letter was not received until //. By this point the damage the reporting had on the borrower 's credit score was significant and halted the refinance process with two lenders. During this period a partial claim modification with Sun West Mortgage was discussed and sent out by Notary on or around //. The partial claim agreement for modification was structured wrong and both we and the Notary contacted Sun West Mortgage that day to advise. We also contacted the VA concierge to have them contact the mortgage company on the proper structuring of the Partial Claim Modification. Naturally, the forbearance was ending on // so we resumed making online payments on //. 
On //, we received a letter from Sun West Mortgage indicating "" we would like to work with you on a Loss Mitigation Home retention ... A Workout Package or request for additional information has already been mailed to you ''. Three days later on //, we received two certified letters address to us individually of "" Notice of Default and Intent To Foreclose ''. We contacted Sun West believing this was an error and were told we needed to speak with a specific agent in Loss Mitigation,  . We left several voicemails between // and // and never received a return call from this agent. 
On //, when we attempted to make our next online payment we received a message that our account was essentially blocked for online payments and we needed to call the number to make payments. When we called, we we expressly told that we Sun West would no longer accept monthly payments for the loan and the full amount from the forbearance period would need to be paid by // for regular monthly payments to resume. 
We called the VA concierge on // who emailed Sun West immediately requesting "" borrower be provided with clarity and detailed loss mitigation status ''. 
On //. , Sun West reported the loan 120-days delinquent to the credit bureaus for , , , // during the forbearance period. This impacted the credit score again, dropping it significantly. We had to contact Sun West again to have this erroneous reporting corrected. 
We finally received the corrected Partial Claim Modification documents on //, more than two months later. The documents were signed, notarized, and returned around //. We received a phone call from Sun West approximately // that a correction was needed on a witness signature for the documents and they would send that page only back via . We received it and made the correction and mailed back around the //. 
On //, we were once again unable to continue making payments as the CARES ACT forbearance allows and when attempted with a phone agent, the Sun West agent again indicated that he was being blocked from making payments also. 
We spoke with multiple individuals from both customer service and the loss mitigation assistance department and none were able to advise us on why we are unable to continue our monthly payments like we began on //. 
On today, //, we called Sun West again to follow up the status of the Partial Claim Modification and were told "" Sun West is restructuring the documents and resending them soon '' by  ( . Assistance Loss Mitigation Team ). 
When ask  when will Sun West remove the block for us to resume monthly payments as the CARES ACT allows, she stated you can always make payments. When we clarified for her the issues we have had and lack clarity of the payments being blocked, she indicated that back in  when the modification was denied, the letter of intent to foreclose was sent and the full amount required to be paid that created our inability to make online payments. However, she could not explain as to why we had been told repeatedly we could not make phone payments directly with Sun West representatives for the past two months and proceeded to schedule multiple payments for the account. 
We have full and complete documentation of everything discussed here. Understanding that Sun West had the ability and options, and our full cooperation to resolve the issues of this complaint for more than 6 months now, we are hoping for some type of accountability that corrects Sun west actions and mishandling of consumer accounts.

Under our homeowner bill of rights we have the right to ask for this information and you keep giving us incomplete information we demand to get complete information. 




I understand that under Section 6 of RESPA you are required to acknowledge my request within 20 business days and must try to resolve the issue within 60 business days. Please treat this letter as a "" qualified written request '' under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 2605 ( e ).

I am writing to you to complain about the accounting and servicing of my mortgage and my need for understanding and clarification of various charges, credits, debits, transactions, reversals, actions, payments, analyses and records related to the servicing of my loan from its origination to the present date. To date, the documents and information I have, that you have sent me, and the conversations with your service representatives can not answer my many questions. 
It is my understanding that your company has been accused as engaging in one or more predatory lending and servicing schemes. As a citizen, I am extremely concerned about such practices by anyone, let alone my own mortgage company or anyone who has held a beneficial interest in my QUALIFIED WRITTEN REQUEST COMPLAINT DISPUTE OF DEBT/ VALIDATION OF DEBT TILA REQUEST Page 2 of 8 loan. I am concerned that such abuses are targeting the uneducated and uninformed consumer and disadvantaged, poor, elderly and minorities.

Needless to say, I am more concerned as an alleged borrower. I am worried that potential fraudulent and deceptive practices by unscrupulous mortgage brokers ; sales and transfers of mortgage servicing rights ; deceptive and fraudulent servicing practices to enhance balance sheets ; deceptive, abusive and fraudulent accounting tricks and practices may have negatively affected my credit rating, mortgage account and/or the debt or payments to which I am legally obligated.

Because of this and other reasons that leave me to believe that I may be a victim of predatory lending, I am disputing the validity of the current debt you claim I owe. By debt I am referring to : 1. The principal balance claimed owed ; 2. My calculated monthly payment, 3. Calculated escrow payment 4. And any fees claimed to be owed by you or any trust or entity you may represent.

I have reason to believe that the loan terms were misrepresented to me at the time of application and further obscured and/
or modified prior to signing. I believe that my income may have been inflated on the application. I also have reason to believe that certain statements were not provided for my approval prior to closing, and that signatures may have been forged on various documents. It is also my belief that certain documents may have not been presented at all. Additionally, I believe that a notary was not physically present to witness my signatures on several pertinent documents and that I was ill advised at the time of closing. 
To independently validate my debt, I need to conduct a complete exam, audit, review and accounting of my mortgage loan from its inception through the present date. Upon receipt of this letter, please refrain from reporting ANY negative credit information [ if any ] to any credit-reporting agency until you respond to each of my requests.

QUALIFIED WRITTEN REQUEST COMPLAINT DISPUTE OF DEBT/ VALIDATION OF DEBT TILA REQUEST Page 3 of 8 I also request that you kindly conduct your own investigation and audit of my account since its inception to validate the debt you currently claim I owe. I would like you to validate this debt so that it is accurate to the penny!

Please do not rely on previous or current servicers or originators  records, assurances or indemnity agreements and refuse to conduct a full audit and investigation of my account. 

I understand that potential abuses by you or a previous servicer could have deceptively, wrongfully, unlawfully and/or illegally : 1. Increased the amounts of my monthly payments 2. Increased the principal balance I owe ; 3. Increased my escrow payments ; 4. Increased the amounts applied and attributed toward interest on my account ; 5. Decreased the proper amounts applied and attributed toward principal on my account ; and/or 6. Assessed, charged and/or collected fees, expenses and misc. charges I am not legally obligated to pay under my mortgage, note and/or deed of trust. 7.

I am thinking about contracting the Home Owners Foreclosure Hotline and/or one of their affiliates to perform a forensic document review of your investigation and audit of my account. To help me decide if I am going to move forward with a third party auditing company, I need : ( 1 ) copies of all documents pertaining to the origination of the alleged mortgage and note including my loan application ( s ), Right to cancel, deed of trust, note, adjustable rate note, addendum to the note for the interest only payment period, truth in lending statements, good faith estimate ( GFE ), HUD 1, appraisal, and all required disclosures and rate sheets QUALIFIED WRITTEN REQUEST COMPLAINT DISPUTE OF DEBT/ VALIDATION OF DEBT TILA REQUEST Page 4 of 8 associated with this transaction for the above referenced loan. The copies should be legible and all documents shall be copied in their entirety.

( 2 ) A copy of the loan history including all payments made, all fees incurred, what has been paid out of the escrow account, and how all payments were applied. This information should cover the ENTIRE life of the loan.

I want to insure that I have not been the victim of such predatory practices.

To insure this, I will be authorizing a thorough review, examination, accounting and audit of my mortgage LOAN #  by a team of mortgage auditors predatory lending experts, consumer advocates, local non-profit agencies, compliance consultants and if needed LEGAL ADVOCATES.

1579,2020-10-01,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"// -    mistakenly paid out two different homeowners insurance premiums. One payment of {$1400.00} was sent to our previous homeowners insurance company to a policy that had been cancelled. Another payment of {$1200.00} was sent to our current homeowners insurance company. This was done unbeknownst to us. 

// -    sells our mortgage to NewRez LLC c/o Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing // - We receive an escrow analysis from NewRez stating our escrow account is {$2600.00} short. After some research, we determined this shortage was due to the overpayment    had made on the cancelled homeowners insurance policy. 

After multiple conversations with NewRez, they advised us to make "" escrow only payments '' to catch up the escrow account. 
The following amounts were paid according to the verbatim amounts multiple representatives advised us to pay in order to balance the escrow and mortgage accounts. The payments were applied incorrectly, resulting in multiple late payment fees and late payment notices to our credit report : // {$1000.00} - Applied as a "" principal only payment '' // {$1600.00} - Marked as "" unapplied payment '' // {$1000.00} - Applied as "" Escrow only payment '' // {$1600.00} - Marked as "" unapplied payment '' // {$2000.00} - This was an amount we were advised to pay in order to bring our account current. Unable to determine what happened to this money once it was sent to NewRez. 
// {$1100.00} - Marked as "" unapplied payment. '' This amount was supposed to make everything "" balance '' according to  with NewRez. He advised us to send the payment in and it would be put in the proper account. He advised us that moving forward, our monthly payment would be $ We paid an overage of {$1600.00} each month moving forward out of an abundance of effort to ensure no further delinquencies would be threatened. 

// - We entered into a forbearance plan as I lost my job due to Covid-19 on //. We continued to make on-time payments of $ /month, as we had been advised to do by NewRez. 

// - NewRez sends us an escrow analysis, wherein they had discovered an overage of {$520.00} had been paid. They sent us a check in the mail, at which point we called NewRez and asked them to simply apply the overage to our monthly mortgage payment, as they were still insisting we were not paying the required monthly amount and were behind. The escrow statement itself determined our monthly payment should read {$1600.00} and not {$1700.00}. However, they continued to bill us {$1700.00} each month, putting the {$1600.00} we were sending into a separate "" suspense account. '' // - The {$520.00} is reapplied to the escrow account as we did not cash the check, believing NewRez was doing as promised and moving that amount into our regular mortgage payment. 

Over the past 6 months, even while in forbearance, we have received letters from NewRez threatening foreclosure if we did not bring our account current. They have filed negative marks against us for late payments to all three credit reporting bureaus, making our credit scores plunge. 

We have spent countless hours on the phone with NewRez, speaking with multiple representatives, supervisors, forbearance departments, and supposed "" escalation '' teams in an attempt to get our account balanced. 
Even through unemployment, we have met our mortgage obligations, paying a week ahead of time, only to receive statements every month that show us months behind with mounting late fees, foreclosure threats, and continued negative reporting to the credit bureaus.

It was confusing and intrusive making the continuing uncertainty and requests for documents . However, throughout this process I complied with each request and in a timely manner.

This was in error and did not constitute the kind of relief I was lead to be believe would result from the loan modification. See Document D. 

3. No Respone from Bayview for Inquiries.

They will not issue us a fixed affordable mortgage rate. The loan was originally {$190000.00}. + a {$50000.00} balloon mortgage. ( which at the time I was lucky enough to pay off the balloon mortgage ) Currently because we tried fixing this with them, they increased the loan to approx. {$210000.00}. That's the help they gave us to put me more in debt. I'm currently at almost 7 % on my rate. The home is now valued at around {$110000.00} and is decreasing more and more in value over the years. Now I'm cut back at work about 12 - 20 hours a week because of this pandemic ( covid - 19 ). 
Every time I have attempted to contact the Bank it is jumping through hoops to get in contact with someone to help. They repeatedly mention they're a debt collector .... Then once you do get a rep on the phone they purposely make it a way to be intimidating over the phone making it impossible for me to talk to them as well.

I was told that I could tack the differed payments onto the end of the loan, pay them off in whole, or ask for a loan modification. I said I wanted to move the payments to the end, but was informed that it had to be done at the time you actually call to stop the forbearance. 
Towards the beginning of , I started calling to inquire about ending forbearance. I started being told I could no longer move the payments to the end of the loan because it was "" not my loan ''. I explained that I was the one who entered forbearance, and was told how I could resolve it. I was told they stopped allowing people who inherited a house to move the payments to the end. I had ONLY two options : the first was to pay all the missed payments in a lump sum and then continue to making the payments as normal, or secondly, to apply with Wells Fargo for a new mortgage loan under my own name. I was told that Wells Fargo was only following    rules ( who owns this particular mortgage ). I spoke with a   representative, who explicitly stated that they do not tell Wells Fargo to limit a customer 's option for ending forbearance, and that all available options should be offered to me for any loan they own. Unfortunately,   does not have the power to make Wells Fargo do the right thing, so referred me to the CFPB. I even contacted my U.S. Representative, though his office was unable to do anything for me than to contact  . All I have been trying to do is to do what millions of other Americans have done- move the payments deferred under forbearance to then end of the loan. I do not have the money necessary to pay a lump sum of all deferred payments, nor can I ( nor would I ) apply for another entirely new mortgage with Wells Fargo.

I have not called them and cussed them out like others  have in this situation as it is not helpful.

We did not sign up with PennyMac. They "" bought '' our mortgage from another company last year, soon after we bought our house. They have bungled the paperwork at every turn and exhibited a pattern of negligence throughout. 

1. Last year, they did not pay our taxes. We ended up paying out of pocket, instead of out of escrow. I see from the escrow records they sent the money SOMEWHERE, but it never arrived where it was supposed to (     ). 

2. Earlier this year, they suddenly said they were charging us for insurance, because we had no insurance company. We did, actually. When the bought the mortgage, THEY NEVER BOTHERED to contact the existing insurer and properly set up where the bill would be sent, again, to escrow. 

PS I would send the documents about the insurance mess, but PennyMac conveniently "" wipes '' their message center over time, so you have no record of past disutes! I managed to save the PDF of one of those exchanges last year. 

This has NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE, ever, in 21 years of us being homeowners, and our mortgage was sold *four times* while we lived in Florida! 

3. So we come to now, and the reason for my panic. I got an email from them saying "" No problem, we're paying your tax bill, it's all good '' and they said not to send them the tax bill. So when I got the   tax bill : a ) It was for a different amount b ) It clearly said "" send this to your lender '' c ) There was no indication on the bill they even knew who PennyMac was. 

( c ) is more frightening because the tax bill in Virginia ALWAYS said who the lender was, and actually said, don't worry about sending this to them, we've already done it. 

So in short, I've been abused enough. Someone needs to fix these problems once and for all. And just maybe, this is a PATTERN of abuse, that should actually be investigated.

The issue we face with Freedom Mortgage is that they are holding the insurance claim funds in escrow despite our repeated requests to apply the funds to the payoff of the mortgage.

I have spoken to , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  ,  , and likely others. No single person takes ownership over our case, which means we must explain our request brand new to every person. When I have asked to speak to the same employee again, I am told the person is busy or unavailable. 
They tell us that we should pay the remaining balance of approximately {$82000.00}, at which point they will apply the insurance funds to the balance of the mortgage. But they refuse to issue an official payoff letter nor provide this process in writing. In my attempts to receive what we need, I have requested and have received two official payoff letters from them. Both state the full amount of the loan, approximately {$230000.00}. 
We have been approved at another bank for a new construction loan, and they will assume the remaining balance of our current mortgage in our new construction loan, but they can not do this without a formal payoff letter that states the true payoff amount of approximately {$82000.00} and a clear statement that in paying this amount, the lien will be clear. 
At one point I even called Freedom to make the payment myself, desperate to move past this, and I asked for instructions on how to wire the funds. The Freedom employee I spoke to was uncomfortable giving me the instructions due to concern that the Loss department would not apply the flood insurance money to the remaining balance. She, herself a Freedom Mortgage employee, did not want to move forward as she was worried that we would make the large payment of funds without guarantee that they would pay off the loan with the funds held in escrow.

We think that Freedom Mortgage is acting unethically. They have zero motivation to apply the flood insurance funds to our loan. Every month they collect a mortgage payment from us, and they are likely collecting interest on the flood insurance funds held in escrow as well.

We had regular trouble with escrow and extra payments applied not to the right account. Finally, we have decided that the best is to stop interacting with Ditech, therefore we need to pay off the mortgage.

What was good : it was a click of a button to get to the amount of the pay-off - done on //. Good stopped right there.

The amount came with completely unclear instructions on how to actually do the payment. I ordered a cashier 's check on my name from my checking account for the full amount of the pay off. As per usual, cashier 's check on my own name can be signed over to anyone with my signature and will be as good as cash. In this case it was a check on my name signed over for the deposit into the account on my name! What can be confusing about it?

Before putting this check into the mail, I decided to call Ditech on Saturday, //. My question was simple - do I need to sign the check on the back or is it fine as is, as the check was on my name and is intended to be deposited into my mortgage account on my name ( the sole owner of the account ), which every other bank on Earth has no problem doing.

My conversation devoted to this one question lasted for about 20 minutes. I was asked to be put on additional alerts, e-mails, etc. Mildly annoying, but ok ... I was talking to . She had no clue what I was asking, asked to do some research multiple times during the conversation by putting me on hold and continued to ignore all my very polite requests to please connect me someone else who might have dealt with pay-offs before. She told me that the check I'm holding is a third party check and they will send it back ... ( where is the third or second party here? Check on my name to be deposited to my account! ). I was upset for several days about this. It is important to know that I'm local to MA, so going to Ditech to resolve this in person was never a possibility.

After all, I decided to not send the check by rather do an electronic direct wire. I went to my bank so that I do a direct wire. With a banker at my side we called Ditech again today, on //, again got   on the phone. The question we had was even simpler : can we, please, have the physical address that is associated with the bank account # that we're wiring the money to. She said we're wiring the money to the    and gave their physical address in NY. The banker who was helping me initiate the wire said : this can't be the case, as you need the address of the final recipient institution. In response  gave the address of Ditech in IL.

1864,2021-10-25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,,"We recently refinanced a mortgage through JP Morgan Chase. The loan we were refinancing was also a Chase loan. We had an escrow impound account on the old loan with a balance of over {$8000.00} which we were paying monthly so they would pay our taxes and insurance. When we refinanced, we said we no longer wanted an escrow/impound account. We were not asked what they should do with the balance in the escrow account and Chase applied it to our loan payoff without our permission. We received a letter from Chase at the time of closing and it stated that if there was a balance, we would get a check in 10 days. When nothing came in 10 days, we questioned where it was and that is when we learned that they applied it to our previous loan payoff. We had been making these payments monthly, in good faith, with the assumption that these funds would be used to pay our taxes and insurance, not to pay down our balance. Now taxes are due and we dont have the {$8000.00} that we had been paying Chase to pay our taxes. 
Chase offered to refinance our new loan but to get the same interest rate we were given on the loan that recorded this week, we would need to pay {$8000.00} in points. Plus, they would consider the loan to be a cash-out since we would receive our impounded amount back. What is the point of that? If we kept our current new loan, they offered to give us {$1000.00} for our trouble but we still owe taxes which are over {$6000.00}. 
They made a mistake on our loan by not asking us what to do with our impound balance, not making the impound account available to pay the now due taxes and now offering to charge us for a cash out loan with points.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,CA,95033,Older American,True,Web,2021-10-25,Closed with explanation,True,True,4842785,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['pay', 'chase', 'impound']"

Approximately 3 years ago upon checking my credit I saw that Nationstar had reported that I had missed 12 mortgage payments, which was completely false. I tried to work with NationStar to get this corrected, as you can imagine what is was doing to my credit, all attempts failed. I was unable to refinance with another lender as my credit was trashed, not only as a result of Nationstar reporting incorrectly but had gone through a nasty divorce. It has now been approximately 2 to 3 years since this occurred and I have been working very hard to improve my credit. In  of  upon checking my credit I found that there was no mortgage reporting on my credit at all.

I am also in dispute about the proper application of payments from the debtor to interest, principal, escrow advances and expenses ( in that order of priority as provided for in the loan instruments ) ; about Wells Fargo Bank 's use of automatically triggered property inspections and broker price opinion charges and fees based on undisclosed accounting for purported arrears ; and about legal fees and expenses that have been attached to my account but that have not been otherwise explained, disclosed, or established to myself. 
To independently validate this debt, I need to conduct a complete exam, audit, review and accounting of this mortgage account from its inception through the present date. I would like Wells Fargo Bank to validate this debt so that it is accurate to the penny. 
I also request that the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau kindly conduct its own investigation and audit of this account since its inception to validate the debt Wells Fargo bank currently claims I owe them as Wells Fargo Bank has blatantly violated the CFPB 's rules and regulations.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,CA,90265,,True,Web,2015-12-08,Closed with non-monetary relief,True,True,1687358,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['modification', 'validate', 'debt']"

The original tax billed in // before the appeal was {} The property was reassessed from {} to {} The bill was decreased after the new tax appeal, and was adjusted to a total of {} for the year //. 

The current // bill per quarter is {} = approx. {} in property taxes for the year.

Customer service has expressed to me that the escrow account is wrong, but can only update it when they receive the tax billing from my township. I have forwarded the billing DIRECTLY from the township tax office to the designated tax department at RoundPoint and they have done nothing. 

It offends me that I have been ignored since //, and have done everything correct. However what really offends me is that someone in some department went in and actually changed the estimated property tax amount due in escrow for the // year. Increased it dramatically when it should have been decreased dramatically.

I did not see an option to update that case, so I created a new one. I 've spent most of the year reading letters of delay from Wells Fargo. Each month I 've paid my mortgage ( see attached document ""   Payments // Through Current '' ) per the payment amount due stated on the Initial Interest Note ( {$1100.00} ) plus an additional {$110.00} for escrow ( see attached document "" Initial Interest Note Original '' ). The payment on this mortgage was interest only for the first ten years, then modified to a new payment amount effective //. My // payment was sent via a letter from my attorney ( see attached document "" 1st Letter to WF // ).

Wells Fargo has finally begun communicating, by sending a proposed settlement agreement ( dated // ) to my attorney. And at virtually the same time, Wells Fargo initiated foreclosure proceedings.

This is very concerning to me as VA is a non judicial foreclosure state, and when a payment is held in a suspense account it appears as though the home owner is behind on payments. I have been in my home 29 years and 7  months, and I have NEVER failed to make a full mortgage payment within the month that it is due. 

I make my payments over the phone toward the end of each month because when I was mailing in my payments, Bayview would delay processing my payments for as long as two weeks. Since I am in an active Chapter  Bankruptcy, no late charges are allowed to be added to my mortgage payment if it is late, but I understand that once my bankruptcy is discharged, my payment will need to be processed no later than the  of each month to avoid late fees.

When I discovered this I immediately called my bank to see if they could halt or suspend the payment. They attemped to do so and were unable to. 

Both payments cleared by bank on //2020 and were "" GOOD FUNDS ''.

On //, I contacted   and an agent and I together called Loan Care in an attempt to solve the issue. We were unable to get the issue resolved with the agent, and we asked to be transferred to a supervisor.   both faxed and emailed documentation that Loan Care requested. 

With each question the   representative and I asked, more obstacles were presented by the agent, couldn't be refunded to the bank, had to be sent by check, takes a minumum of 10 days, fax might not be found, delay delay, etc., etc. To say the process was frustrating was an understatement. 

The Supervisor eventually found the information   sent and started a new "" ticket '' number . At the end of the call, however, we felt that the new ticket would be resolved. 

That was 2 and 1/2 weeks ago, and NO communication has come from Loan care. They have refused to return the overpayment. I notified them on the  that if I did not have the refund by // I would be contact the CFPB. That didn't phase them one little bit.

1994,2020-01-12,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"// : Received a letter in the mail on // from my Condo Insurance Company stating that my insurance had lapsed and was cancelled // at  as the initial payment was not received. They stated that I had 15 days from that date to make the payment to get the policy reinstated. I immediately called NewRez Mortgage ( Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ) to question why my Condo Insurance was not paid. The Representative stated that it had been paid and provided check numbers. Then upon further investigation, she finds that it had in fact, NOT been paid and could not explain why. She assured me that a check would be sent out by // and I should call my insurance company and let them know a check was coming. She and I reviewed the information for which the premium should be sent to ( name and address ) and we got off the phone. I called my condo insurance company immediately after and confirmed a check would be sent //. 
// : Noted an Insurance Premium Disbursement in the amount of {$550.00} on my statement. 
// : Upon review of my account I found that NewRez Mortgage ( Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ) had charge me a late fee of {$67.00} on //. I knew this to be an error as I usually pay my mortgage well before the  of the month. As I investigated the problem further I found that on // they took my regular bi-weekly mortgage payment in the amount of {$1300.00} and applied it as a Principle Only Payment. I also found that in // another one of my bi-weekly regular payments was applied as another Principle Only Payment in the amount of {$1300.00} disrupting my payments. I then called NewRez Mortgage ( Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ) and began questioning them as to why they were applying my payments as Principle Only and charging me late fees. She stated that it was a computer error and was because I did not make ACH payments through NewRez Mortgage ( Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ). It was then explained that I have made all payments through my bank every other week since // without issue. I requested that these errors be fixed and flagged to decrease the possibility of repetition, and I wanted the late fee removed immediately. She then stated it would take 3-5 business days to be corrected and reflect correctly on the account. 
// : After speaking with NewRez Mortgage ( Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ) in the morning I then received a phone call from NewRez Mortgage ( Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ) in the afternoon and of course I answered the call as I believed it would be in regards to the accounting errors. The   woman ( who was very hard to understand ) requested that I hold for her manager, so I agreed to wait. The male   man that got on the phone started the conversation with, Why havent you responded to our letters and phone calls! I began asking him what his phone call was in regards to because I did not receive any letters or phone calls from Shellpoint. He started yelling at me, You need to listen to me ... I explained that I am not interested in being solicited for a mortgage refinance and not to call my home again. I work the night shift and sleep during the day and again I did not want to be solicited ever again. This man was so disgusting, he told me to go back to bed, and I will call you anytime this financial institution warrants him to call. He then began to state that he wants to talk with me about a LOAN MODIFACTION. Again, I told him that I am not interested and ended up hanging up on this man because he would not take no for an answer. When I got off the phone, I was overwhelmed with the idea that this might be a scam phone call but my caller ID said it was Shellpoint and I began to investigate why my own Mortgage company would be calling me trying to pressure me into a Loan Modification. And it seems that because of the obvious account errors in the form of Principle Only Payments, it looks like I am not paying my mortgage on time and the late fees flagging Shellpoint to call me. I have since written a letter requesting no further solicitation from NewRez LLC/Shellpoint including in the mail, email, text message or phone calls. 
// : Called NewRez ( NewRez LLC/Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ) again in  regarding // & // payments applied as Principle Only Payments again. I requested to speak to a supervisor and got hung up on/disconnected. I was also calling about the accounting ledger provided from both my online account and from the statements mailed to me. I explained that I was unable to determine what exactly has been corrected as all the transactions have the same date, and it makes no sense what they have done with my mortgage payments. I requested that an accurate accounting ledger of actual payments, noted on the actual dates the payments were made and then the actual date they fixed the payment be mailed to me immediately. I have not seen anything from NewRez showing actual dates. And the manager on the phone informed me it would take 24-48 hours to see the changes applied from the  accounting mistakes. 
// : Found a major water leak inside the walls of my Condo. 
// : Filed a claim with my Condo Insurance provider . Representative informed me that , my adjuster, would be in contact with me in 1-2 business days.

Called and spoke to a representative who told me that she did not have , the adjusters telephone number and would have to leave him an email. When I asked her if it was normal company policy for it to take a week to make contact with their customer to start processing a claim? She stated, no. She stated  would call me the next day.

// @  : Spoke with a representative about  Condo Insurance not having been paid. Representative informed me that it had been paid by CK #  sent on // and that the check had cleared on //. I then requested for her to call  and give them the check numbers and resolve this with them. She placed me on a HOLD and called the insurance company. She came back and said she was not able to call them and needed 24-48 hours. I then informed her of a noted transaction on my // Mortgage Statement that says on // Insurance Refund {$550.00}. If they paid my condo insurance why was there a refund for insurance? She stated she would need to investigate and call me back. 
// :  from NewRez called and left a message. I called her back at , and she disclosed that they had mailed a check to the wrong company to the wrong address. It was mailed to    and not my insurance company    . I did not understand how they had the wrong company since they had paid them before, there were no changes in insurance companies and I called in  to confirm they were being paid! I then asked her what the company policy was regarding informing the customer of an insurance loss or lapse. She stated, You should have been notified by letter in 7 days and that did not happen. I informed her that moving forward I would have to consult an attorney and that I am requesting that my loan be sold to another company. She states, I will move this along to my supervisors for further investigation. 
Because NewRez LLC/Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing did not pay my insurance premium in // I went unknowingly 3 months without Condo Insurance. Had I known they did not actually pay it, I would have paid it myself. No premium payment ment I had no policy with  and ultimately NO CLAIM. I have had to come up with {$5200.00} out of my own pocket a week before . I have since sent a demand letter to NewRez/Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing to be reimbursed for the damages. This has been a huge emotional and financial burden. 
I have serious concern about the accounting practices of NewRez LLC/Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. I have had to call and speak with them every month on how to apply my payments. They charge late fees when it is their accounting error. They do not complete the basic tasks of managing an escrow account, for example paying insurance premiums on time and providing an accurate accounting ledger of mortgage payments. I would like for NewRez LLC to sell my loan to ANYONE else, as I have lost confidence in their ability to manage my loan.",Company believes complaint is the result of an isolated error,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",CA,93036,Servicemember,True,Web,2020-01-12,Closed with explanation,True,True,3493572,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['mortgage', 'insurance', 'payment']"

They failed to follow guidelines for consumer lending and advertising by stringing out my loan application and using arbitrary reasons to terminate my loan offer because rates had gone up. There was no attempt by the lender to close the loan as quickly as advertised. They intentionally delayed my application because the Federal Government was expected to raise interest rates and they did not want to honor the rate they had offered to me. They advertise closing on loans within days and this was reiterated by representatives throughout my application process. In reality, they would regularly request new documents drafted attorneys, and that required notarization, all at my expense. Each time I took time off work to have the documents drafted, notarized, and returned to them in a timely manner. They would not review documents in a timely manner. For example, I may not hear anything for several days until they request a revision that should have been previously specified. And again, I took time off work to have the document drafted and notarized at my expense. On or about the afternoon of the //2022, the United States Government raised interest rates. On or about the evening of //2022, the lender made a brand new request for documents. Less than  business hours later, they cancelled my loan application because it was not approved within 14 days. It was not approved within 14 days because of their broken and unprofessional approval process. I am a 100 %  Veteran and the lenders actions have aggravated my health. The lenders actions have also caused me to : . ) lose the loan rate that I had locked which will cost me thousands of dollars ;  ) cost time/stress trying to accommodate their overly burdensome requests ;  ) damaged my credit ;  ) it will cost time/stress of seeking other funding at a higher rates.

I was shocked when after my first completion of data the Rate was 1.75 % but the APR was considerably higher. I emailed the loan officer about this and they made an adjustment claiming that they added {$8100.00} in concessions to the loan in order to honor the pricing, however, they changed my own selections on several different aspects of the loan which would be about ( 63 % LTV ). They changed my escrow preferences to utilizing Betters services, when I had originally indicated I would continue to pay my home insurance and property taxes without escrow. When I changed these items back the loan added what I think I recall as {$250.00} in points, despite the advertising being {$0.00}. I asked for this to be adjusted and they claimed this was a change of circumstances. No where on their website can I find that escrow is a required aspect to receive their advertised rates. I checked  website and it is also not addressed. If this was common practice then it should be spelled out. Over the next two days while I completed their tasks, the points rose again close to {$250.00} per day to approximately {$750.00}. Final closing amount was {$720.00}.
